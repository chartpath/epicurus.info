    <p align="justify"><b>Introduction to Ethics</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In contemporary society, the word
    “ethics” tends to conjure up a cornucopia of negative connotations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>We usually encounter the term when it is woven into tales of scandal,
    liability, prosecution, political fallout, and corporate corruption.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The word “morality” is perhaps equally unappealing; in the minds
    of many, it mainly signifies an obligatory repression of sensuality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>In terms of Epicureanism, however, “ethics” and “morality”
    are synonymous terms that simply mean: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">strategy.</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </i>Ethical or moral issues
    do not center upon legalese and lust, but rather upon selecting an ultimate
    goal<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </i>(or <i>telos </i>in Greek) and
    practicing a<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i>consistent policy of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">choice
    and avoidance</i> to achieve that goal.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">But before we attempt to set forth, we
    must first settle an important preliminary matter: is it even possible for
    an individual to shape the course of his life in the first place?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Or is the future predestined by inexorable circumstances beyond his
    control?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To assert the former
    is to take the position of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">free will;</i> to assume the latter is to take the position of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fatalism</i>.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Free Will and its Detractors</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Epicureanism calls for a firm belief in
    the existence of free will, i.e. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">volition</i>,
    without which its ethical teachings would have little meaning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>For what’s the use of studying a system of choice and avoidance if
    all of our choices are predetermined by fate in the first place?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This issue has been sharply debated by
    philosophers and scientists alike throughout recorded history.&nbsp; Perhaps
    the most prevalent challenge to the position of free will is the physical
    doctrine of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">determinism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span></i>While this view of the universe is a
    convenient for mathematicians, it also carries the baggage of some strange
    portents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For if the universe
    was indeed deterministic, then everything that ever happens—from the far
    reaches of outer-space to the inner-sanctums of every human brain—would
    have to occur out of necessity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Life
    would be entirely non-interactive: “every breath you take and every move you
    make”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span> would be choreographed for all eternity, with no chance whatsoever to
    deviate even slightly from nature’s script.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>This scenario is hardly compatible with the idea that we have the
    power to sway the outcome of our lives!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>But while most adherents of determinism do reject volition, other
    determinists are certainly uncomfortable in doing so, judging by the number
    of desperate proposals to reconcile the two beliefs!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Arguments for this sort of “compatibilism” are as wide-ranging in
    approach as they are numerous—but they all tend to focus on semantics
    rather than the substance of the dilemma.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Epicurus, however, circumvents this paradox by calmly rejecting
    determinism outright.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">A more serious challenge to the position
    of free will is the argument of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">reductionism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span></i>Whether the universe is deterministic or indeterministic is of no
    consequence to the reductionist’s argument—he will assert that free will
    cannot exist in either scenario.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
    if we accept the materialist premise that the mind must be an ensemble of
    matter, then to assert that the mind has the power of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">choice</i>
    is tantamount to ascribing this power to “matter itself.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>But if we also accept the premise of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">non-teleology—</i>that
    bits of matter are passive agents bungling through space and time without
    purpose nor intention—then how can we suppose that a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">purposeful </i>entity can a purposeless universe?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>“So what if matter has some unpredictable attributes,” the
    reductionist shrugs, “all this implies for the mind is that it is a puppet
    of random forces rather than fixed ones.”<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>In neither case, he concludes, can matter be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">directed</i> by deliberate conscious control.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">It is true enough
    that while the position of the indeterminism, such as Epicurus' doctrine of
        the atomic swerve, allows for the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">possibility</i>
    for voluntary action, indeterminism by itself does not guarantee its
    existence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A human statue,
    after all, might contain about as many atoms as you do—and while the atoms
    in marble may “swerve”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span> just as much as the atoms in your flesh, it doesn’t
    therefore follow that a statue has free will!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Obviously, there must be an important difference between statues and
    humans, and there is:<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> the way they are
    built.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Volition is a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">secondary attribute</i>, which depends just as much upon the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">atomic
    configuration</i> of its constituent matter as it does upon the very
    presence of the matter itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    is possible for an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">active will</i> to emerge from passive atoms in the same way that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">life,
    consciousness,</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">intelligence</i>
    can emerge from atoms which are lifeless, unconscious, and utterly
    oblivious.&nbsp; This is why the reductionist, who looks
    for volition in one atom at a time, will indeed never find it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>What he neglects to understand is the principle of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">synergy—</i>i.e., the properties of the<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal"> whole </i>are not always limited to the properties of its part.&nbsp;
    For if they were, then there could not even be any such thing as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">awareness</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Your mind would not really exist—there would just be a human body
    that, while it lasts, responds to your name and exhibits “complex
    behavior.”</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Introspective<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
    </i>evidence tells us otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
    do appreciate the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">spectacular</i> difference between awareness and oblivion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>We <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">experience</i> the reality
    of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">feel</i>
    pleasure and pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, we
    can<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal"> discern</i> the difference between what it is like to be compelled and
    what it is like to initiate action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    distinction is as self-evident today as it was over two thousand years ago
    when Lucretius observed:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><a name="TCE12"></a>We change
      direction not because it is time to do so<br>
      or because we are where we must, but because we <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">want</i>
      to.<br>
      Without a doubt, it is our wills that begin these movements<br>
      which are carried out through our limbs.<br>
      Haven’t you seen, at the moment the barriers open<br>
      at the start of a race, the horses, as if hesitating,<br>
      unable to throw themselves forward as fast as they want to?<br>
      The whole of their matter has to be brought into motion,<br>
      which means that the messages have to run through their bodies<br>
      till every bit is altered and moves with the mind.<br>
      As you see, the impetus comes from within;<br>
      The movement starts in the mind and in the will;<br>
      From there it spreads through the limbs and through the whole body.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000080">It is not at all the same thing when
      we move at the instance<br>
      of an overpowering force, or simply because someone pushes us.<br>
      In that case the material of the whole body<br>
      obviously moves in spite of us, hurried onwards<br>
      until the will succeeds in curbing it.<br>
      The fact is that external forces may move us<br>
      and hurry us onwards by the scruff of our necks;<br>
      Yet in spite of this, there still is something inside us<br>
      which can put up a struggle and get in the way of them.<br>
      It is this which controls the material of our bodies<br>
      and by a certain adjustment of our limbs<br>
      brings them up in their flight and returns them to rest.<br>

    </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">So having recognized our capacity for
    volition as genuine, we may now review Epicurus’ strategic guidelines with
    the necessary confidence in our ability to make use of it.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>The <i>Telos</i> of Epicurean Ethics</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Epicurus identified <i>ataraxia</i>—the
        absence of disturbance—as the pinnacle of pleasure and the
    ideal moral goal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not
    choose this goal arbitrarily; he did so because of its special significance
    in human nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He observed
    that humans, like all other sentient creatures which inhabit the earth, are
    naturally constituted to relish pleasure, and abhor pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Hence, we are already predisposed to seek out the former, and to
    avoid the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When at last
    we find ourselves undisturbed by any sort of discomfort whatsoever, we feel
    fully satisfied and lack the urge to seek out anything more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>At this point, one has <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">arrived,</i>
    Epicurus surmises, at “the goal prescribed by nature.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Lucius Torquatus, the Epicurean proponent featured in Cicero’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">De Finibus</i> (“On Goals”), puts this matter in clear perspective:&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><a name="TCE11"></a>The truth of the
      proposition that pleasure is the ultimate good will most readily appear
      from the following illustration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let
      us imagine a man living in the continuous enjoyment of numerous and vivid
      pleasures alike of body and of mind, undisturbed either by the presence or
      by the prospect of pain: what possible state of existence could we
      describe as being more excellent or more desirable? … His lot will be
      one which will not admit of further improvement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Suppose, on the other hand, a person crushed beneath the heaviest
      load of mental and of bodily anguish to which humanity is liable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Grant him no hope of ultimate relief in view; also give him no
      pleasure either present or in prospect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Can one describe or imagine a more pitiable state?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000080">If then, a life full of pain is the
      thing most to be avoided, it follows that to live in pain is the highest
      evil; and this position implies that a life of pleasure is the ultimate
      good. … This being so, it clearly follows that actions are right and
      praiseworthy only as being a means to the attainment of a life of
      pleasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that which is
      not itself a means to anything else, but to which all else is a means, is
      what the Greeks term the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">telos</i>,
      the highest, ultimate or final Good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It must therefore be admitted that the chief Good is to live
      happily. - </font>Cicero, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">On
      Ends, Good and Bad I.XII</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This is the appealing destiny that
    Epicurus beckons us to fulfill.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>What is now left to us is the task of finding our way there.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Enlightened Hedonism</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Because Epicurus integrates <i>pleasure</i>
    into the ideal moral goal, Epicureanism can be rightly
    regarded as a morality of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">hedonism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span></i>We have already made the observation that we are predisposed by
    nature to pursue pleasure—so what more is there to know?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>Plenty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To suppose
    that “pursuing pleasure” is all one needs to know about living the
    ethics of hedonism is like supposing that “following the road” is all
    there is to know about driving a car; some additional knowledge and skill
    are required to negotiate freeway interchanges and hairpin turns—none is
    required to get lost, or to plow into embankments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Hence, Epicureans aren’t the kind of impulsive, cavalier
    “hedonists” who are commonly associated with the term.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Epicureanism entails a more deliberate approach to pursuing
    pleasures—one in which the potential for negative consequences does not
    escape our consideration.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">“No pleasure is a bad thing in
    itself,” Epicurus reminds us in his eighth <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Principal
    Doctrine</i>, “but the means which produce some pleasures bring with them
    disturbances many times greater than the pleasures themselves.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Hence, not all pleasurable avenues are deemed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">choice-worthy.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If, for
    example, someone elects to drink himself into a stupor in the evening, only
    to wake up with head-splitting hangover the following day, then he is not a
    very successful hedonist by Epicurean standards!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The pleasure he gained to begin with was offset by the discomfort
    which came afterwards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    <a href="insights/6-2.html"><img border="0" src="insights/6-2t.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="6"></a></span>Because
    many activities can bring <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mixed
    results</i> in terms of pleasure and pain, it is essential to factor in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">both
    </i>sides of the scale, so to speak, to see which way the balance is
    tipped—otherwise, we risk losing ground in our journey towards our
    intended goal. Progress cannot be made by taking one step forward and two
    steps back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is why
    alcoholics are typically unhappy: it’s not because being inebriated is
    unpleasurable, but because drinking excessively brings unsettling
    consequences in its wake.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Hence, Epicureans realize that any method
    of achieving short-term comfort which necessitates a long-term annoyance
    should be avoided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While on the
    other hand, any long-term comfort that can be secured at the price of a
    brief annoyance is a hedonistic bargain worthy of selection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Ancient sources reveal that Epicurus had set forth some practical
    guidelines in a book entitled “On Choice and Avoidance,” but the
    manuscript itself has since been lost to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Fortunately, we do have enough in the way of commentary and other
    writings to enable us to piece together his advice.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>The 3-Fold Classifications of Desires</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">One surviving maxim in particular, the
    twenty-ninth <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Principal Doctrine</i>,
    serves as the best starting point—Epicurus’ three-fold classification of
    desires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Among desires,”
    he wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><a name="PD29"></a></font>[1] <font color="#000080">some
      are natural and necessary,<br>
      </font>[2] <font color="#000080">some natural but not necessary,<br>
      </font>[3] <font color="#000080">and others neither natural nor necessary,
      but due to vain opinion.<br>
      </font>- Epicurus, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Principal
      Doctrine 29</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">“Natural” in this context, means <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">abundant in nature</i>, while “necessary” means <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">necessary to remove pain</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
    distinctions will become clearer as we proceed through some examples.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The class of “natural and necessary”
    desires are for those things will necessarily lead to greater pain if they
    are not fulfilled—yet, in ordinary circumstances, they can be fulfilled
    rather easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nourishment,
    shelter, health, companionship, and a sense of security are interrelated
    requirements which all belong to this basic category.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The class of “natural and unnecessary”
    desires are for those things which <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">do
    not</i> necessarily lead to greater pain if left unfulfilled, even though
    fulfillment may be easy to obtain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
    appetites are typically recreational in nature: theatre, travel, cuisine,
    sexual intercourse, and so on.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The class of “unnatural and
    unnecessary” desires are for those things which not only do not
    necessarily lead to greater pain if they are not fulfilled, but are realized
    only at the price of an ongoing burden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Fame, status, political power, extraordinary wealth, and other
    ambitions which have the trappings of “prestige” all belong to this last
    category.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Epicurean Strategies</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In dealing with each class of desires,
    Epicurus recommends particular strategies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>First of all, we should go about satisfying the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">necessary</i>
    desires in the most economical way possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>A predominately simple and nutritious diet will satisfy hunger and
    health, modest living quarters can adequately supply physical comfort, and
    consummating friendships will go far to secure both the need for
    companionship and confidence of aid in times of distress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Studying the nature of the universe, so that we may confidently
    reject the absurdities of superstition, is also essential to enhancing our
    sense of security.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Secondly, our efficiency in dealing with
    the preceding frees up our remaining resources to explore the large variety
    of “natural and unnecessary” desires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>These we may pursue to our heart’s content, so long as they do not
    interfere with our ability to satisfy our natural and necessary desires.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, we must never risk nor sacrifice our health,
    friendships, finances, or standing with the law, for the sake of pursuing
    leisure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If we ever feel
    tempted to do so, it’s best to switch our attention to a less costly
    desire in this abundant category so that we may receive our pleasures
    untarnished by the prospects of future hardship.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Thirdly, we come to the “unnatural and
    unnecessary” desires, for which Epicurus’ advice is unequivocal: we
    should avoid them entirely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
    is because the fulfillment of unnatural desires is difficult to attain, and
    impossible to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">maintain</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We may, for
    instance, relish the limelight of fame (which seems to last up to “fifteen
    minutes” according to twentieth-century artist Andy Warhol!) but we may
    have to put up with stalkers and the paparazzi for a lifetime.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>Political power invariably creates enemies, and often
    attracts hostility, usurpers, or even assassins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Opulent wealth attracts thieves, kidnappers, and politicians. It’s
    no wonder that Classical Epicureans lived by the motto “Live in
    anonymity!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For ultimately,
    the pinnacle of <i>ataraxia </i>can be the same experience for
    everybody—be they eminent or unknown, rich or poor, young or old,
    sophisticated or simple.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Hence, the Epicurean keeps the objective
    of experiential bliss always close at hand, merely by keeping himself
    well-nourished, well-housed, well-educated, and well-entertained.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>These basic requirements can be satisfied with a modest
    income, but they are by no means any less rewarding than the wider range of
    more competitive undertakings commonly held to be prerequisites for
    emotional fulfillment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For just
    as it’s usually more feasible to adjust our expenses than our income, it
    is usually more feasible still to adjust our attitudes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>“If you wish to make Pythocles rich,” Epicurus once counseled,
    “do not give him more money, but diminish his desire.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>For happiness is an internal victory that transcends outward
    circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Getting the most
    out of life is therefore not a matter of somehow “outdoing” the
    victories of others, but rather a matter of <i>prolonging victories within
    ourselves.</i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Enlightened Egoism</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This emphasis on self-awareness makes
    Epicurean ethics <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">egoistic</i>—a term
    which is no less often abused than <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">hedonistic</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>But just as it is possible to conceive of a hedonist whose concerns
    extend beyond the pleasures of the immediate moment, so too is it possible
    to conceive of an egoist whose self-interest extends beyond the horizon of
    his epidermis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For as long as
    human beings continue to live in a social context, it will always be to our
    mutual advantage to appreciate each other’s concerns, so that we might
    effectively collaborate with one another in our common journey towards
    achieving <i>ataraxia</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
    distinctive custom of goodwill is best exemplified by Epicurus’ own
    illustrious life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
    biographer, Diogenes Laërtius, reports that…</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font color="#000080"><a name="TCE13"></a>There
      are plenty of witnesses of the unsurpassable kindness of the man to
      everybody—both his own country which honored him with brazen statues,
      and his friends who are so numerous that they could not be counted in
      whole cities. </font>- Diogenes Laërtius, <i>Lives X.V</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">It is not by accident that Epicurus
    acquired his venerable reputation; he practiced kindness <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">intentionally</i>,
    and consequently procured a tremendous pleasure-payoff in the form of
    reciprocated kindness from the multitudes of admirers who befriended him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Consequently, a deep reverence for the institution of friendship
    is a renowned hallmark of Epicureanism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">De Finibus,</i> we see this
    attitude reflected in the monologue of Torquatus, where he explains to
    Cicero why friendship is a hedonistic imperative:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><a name="TCE14"></a>Your school
      [Cicero’s Stoicism] maintains that if pleasure be the Chief Good,
      friendship will cease to exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now
      Epicurus’ pronouncement about friendship is that of all the means to
      happiness that wisdom has devised, none is greater, none more fruitful,
      none more delightful than this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor
      did he only commend this doctrine by his eloquence, but far more by the
      example of his life and conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How
      great a thing friendship is, is shown by the mythical stories of
      antiquity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Review the legends
      from the remotest ages, and, copious and varied as they are, you will
      barely find in them three pairs of friends, beginning with Theseus and
      ending with Orestes.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet Epicurus in single house, and that a small one,
      maintained a whole company of friends, united by the closest sympathy and
      affection; and this still goes on in the Epicurean school.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000080">[…]</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000080">A solitary, friendless life must be
      beset by secret dangers and alarms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence
      reason itself advises the acquisition of friends; their possession gives
      confidence, and a firmly rooted hope of winning pleasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>And just as hatred, jealousy and contempt are hindrances to
      pleasure, so friendship is the most trustworthy preserver and also creator
      of pleasure alike for our friends and for ourselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It affords us enjoyment in the present, and it inspires us with
      hopes for the near and distant future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Thus it is not possible to secure uninterrupted gratification in
      life without friendship, nor yet to preserve friendship itself unless we
      love our friends as much as ourselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Hence this unselfishness does occur in friendship, while also
      friendship is closely linked with pleasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>For we rejoice in our friends’ joy as much as in our own, and are
      equally painted by their sorrows. - </font>Cicero,
      <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">On Ends, Good and Bad I.XX</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">It is therefore only natural that the Epicurean
    ethic engenders magnanimity and empathy.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>As far-sighted intelligent beings, it isn’t hard for us to
    realize what advantages there are in having friends to rely on in times of
    need, versus facing life’s challenges in isolation.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Cardinal Virtues</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">I</span>t is with similar consistency that
    Epicurus recommends
    acting in ways that are widely regarded as noble, decent, and righteous.
    These precepts are the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cardinal
    virtues: wisdom, honor, </i>and<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
    justice</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the context of
    Epicureanism however, their significance is not rooted in peer-approval, but
    rather in their productiveness of pleasure within ourselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>In his fifth Principal Doctrine, Epicurus states that the
    relationship between pleasure and virtue is inseparable:&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><a name="PD5"></a>It is impossible
      to live a pleasant life without living wisely, honorably and justly, and
      it is impossible to live wisely, honorably and justly without living
      pleasantly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whenever any one
      of these is lacking, when, for instance, the man is not able to live
      wisely, though he lives honorably and justly, it is impossible for him to
      live a pleasant life. </font>- Epicurus, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Principal
      Doctrine 5</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">It is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">wisdom</i>
    (also rendered as “intelligence” or “prudence” in translation) which
    Epicurus identifies as the most fundamental cardinal virtue.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>To live wisely, by Epicurean standards, is to bring a broad
    awareness of Nature down to the level of our daily existence, thereby establishing a context for
    intelligent choice-making.&nbsp; Epicurus held that t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">he
    most common obstacles to happiness were, in fact, due to lapses in our
    understanding of Nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    bringing forth enlightenment, Epicurus formulated his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tetrapharmakos</i>,
    or “four-fold remedy.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
    set of four precepts is found among the opening maxims of Epicurus’ forty
    “Principal Doctrines,” and is summarized by Philodemus thus: “God
    presents no fears, death no worries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;
    </span>And while good is readily attainable, evil is readily endurable.”</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The second cardinal virtue named by
    Epicurus is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">honor</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>To live honorably is to have the courage to persevere in the face of
    difficulties, whenever the prospects for ideal happiness become obstructed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>This implies that we assert the moral course we set for ourselves
    with consistency, without ever betraying our professed standards for the
    sake of expediency.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>Honor also engenders fair treatment—a willingness to pay
    respect in accordance with how we ourselves would like to be respected, and
    conversely, an unwillingness to tolerate abuse.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Thirdly, Epicurus recognizes the virtue of
    <a name="justice"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">justice</i></a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>Like the other virtues, justice is not considered by
    Epicureans to be an “absolute good,” but rather an obligatory means for
    securing happiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The nature
    of this obligation is contractual; justice is grounded upon a promise not to
    initiate harm against one’s peers, nor to permit such wrongdoing to go
    unpunished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Throughout history,
    it has proved mutually advantageous for individuals to band together into
    societies implicitly or explicitly embracing this kind of pact, because,
    according to Epicurus, “the greatest fruit of justice is peace of mind.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>When we live under conditions of assured protection, we can derive
    solace from the expectation that we will not fall prey to criminal acts, or
    in the unlikely event that we do, that there will at least be avenues of
    recourse available to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, those who try to cheat the social covenant by committing
    crimes are subject to perpetual anxieties that accompany the prospects of
    looming retaliation.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The rewards for adopting the cardinal
    virtues as a matter of personal policy are of no small consequence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The difference between living wisely or unwisely makes the difference
    between a life of fulfillment versus a life of bewilderment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The difference between living honorably or dishonorably makes the
    difference between a life galvanized by a sense of dignity versus a life
    undermined by a sense of shame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    difference between living justly or unjustly makes the difference between
    harboring a sense of security versus a sense of futility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Collectively, the degree to which these virtues are put into practice
    directly corresponds to the degree to which misery is expelled and happiness
    achieved.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Politics</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> Epicureanism may seem wholly
    apolitical, especially when compared to the extensive treatment of political
    matters given by his most prominent philosophical predecessors: Plato and
    Aristotle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For Epicurus did not
    develop a particular schema for an ideal government—he was instead
    concerned about what constitutes the ideal individual.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">But the ethics of Epicureanism is not
    without political implications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Laws,”
    says Epicurus, “are made for the sake of the wise, not to prevent them
    from inflicting wrong but to save them from suffering it.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Hence, Epicureans are keen to determine whether their political
    climate is conducive to justice or if it falls short of this noble paradigm or
    perhaps even works against it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    cases where disagreeable laws are in force, Epicurus still recommends
    obedience, so long as the sacrifices required are insignificant; but if the
    demands of society become excessive, it’s time to move on, as Epicurus
    himself found occasion to do so when he fled Mytilene (This was the locale
    of Epicurus’ first school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
    issue was the educational monopoly enforced by local officials, the
    “gymnasiarchs.”)&nbsp; The Homeric character Teucer sums up the Epicurean
    political attitude
    succinctly with his line: “My country is wherever I am happy.”</p>
