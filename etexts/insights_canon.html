    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Consciousness</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">As conscious organisms, we human beings do
    not merely <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">react</i> to the universe,
    but <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">experience</i> it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Even though, according to atomism, an individual’s brain and body are ultimately
    comprised of solid impregnable elements, the structure as a whole forms
    an immensely complex physique that is delicate and pliable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The focal point of experience is that which we regard as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">consciousness</i>,
    otherwise known as the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">intellect,</i>
    the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mind, or </i>the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">s</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">oul, </i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">which
    </span>Epicurus described as being...</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="Citation" align="justify"><a name="TCE3"><font color="#000080"></font></a><font color="#000080">…
      composed of light particles, diffused over all the members of the body…<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>There exists in it a special part, endowed with an extreme
      mobility, in consequence of the exceeding slightness of the elements which
      compose it, and also in reference to its more immediate sympathy with the
      rest of the body. - </font>Epicurus, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Letter
      to Herodotus 63</i></p>
    </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">But we must dispel with the religious connotations that the
    term “soul” conjures up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    soul is neither immaterial nor immortal, but rather a distinctive component of a living organism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That the
    soul is affected by the senses is proof enough of its material nature, for
    if the soul was utterly immaterial, then it would be no different from empty
    space; mass and energy would pass right through it, and the surrounding
    universe could not be detected by the mind in any way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>But in reality, the soul is continuously bombarded by mass and
    energy, yielding an evident perception of our environment.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>The Passions</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The range of what is knowable to
        the human intellect is not limited to what surrounds and impinges us;
        the inner self, beneath our skin, is a complex realm of intrigue that
        contributes profoundly to our repertoire of experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>No theory of knowledge would be complete without its inclusion.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The mentalities of all conscious
        beings are structured in such a manner that the sensations may have a
        direct influence on behavior: some sensations <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sustain</i>
        the current state of mind, inclining an organism to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">maintain</i>
        its present course of action; while others <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">disrupt</i>
        the state of mind, inclining an organism to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">change</i>
        its course of action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
        two phenomena are respectively experienced as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">pleasure</i>
        and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">pain, </i>and collectively
        termed the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">passions </i>in the
        parlance of classical philosophers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>What a living being shall experience as pleasurable and painful
        is not randomly assigned at birth—the passions are inherently biased
        by our nature.&nbsp; For Epicurus in particular, pleasure and pain are
        of central importance to his system of ethics.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Presentations &amp; Representations</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In the terminology of Epicurean philosophy,
    any sensory event that can be consciously registered is regarded as a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">presentation</i>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-footnote-id: ftn1" class="MsoFootnoteReference">&nbsp;
    </span></a>Every time we receive a presentation, sensory impulses impinges
        our minds,
    giving us an instinctive ability to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">recognize</i>
    reoccurring themes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Similar
    shapes projected upon our eyes, similar sounds reverberating in our ears,
    similar tastes and smells that tickle our palate, similar feelings that
    touch us inside and out—all of these patterns are reinforced into our
    memories with each occurrence, giving rise to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">representations
        (</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">i.e., preconceptions) </i>in our imagination.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"> An ancient inscription on the wall of Oinoanda<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-footnote-id: ftn3" class="MsoFootnoteReference">
        </span></a>describes this phenomenon reasonably well:</p>
      <blockquote>
    <p class="Citation" align="justify"><font color="#000080">What is viewed by sight
    is impressed upon the soul, and after the impression of the original images,
    passages are opened up in us in such a way that, even when the objects which
    we originally saw are no longer present, our mind bears representations of
    the original objects.&nbsp;<br>
    - </font>Diogenes
    of Oinoanda,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><i>new fragment
    5.3.3-14</i></p>
      </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Attributes</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Through the accumulation of
    representations we learn to
    recognize <i>attributes:</i> shapes, sizes, hues, tones, flavors, scents, textures,
    etc.&nbsp; Epicurean philosophy posits that some
    attributes are axiomatic, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">primary
    attributes,</i> while the rest are the synergistic: secondary attributes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Primary attributes are those innate qualities which are inseparable
    from the basic constitution of the universe: the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">solidity,
    size, shape, weight,</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">motion</i>
    of the atoms—the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">intangibility,</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">boundlessness, </i>and (more recently conjectured) <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">shape</i> of the void.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><a name="secondary"></a>Secondary
    attributes are founded upon the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">positional
    arrangements</i> of multiple atoms that, by happenstance, produce
    presentations that are distinguishable by the mind.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">For instance, the tangibility of a leaf is
    derived from a primary attribute: the solidity of the atoms within it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>But the greenness of a leaf is a secondary attribute—it is not
    comprised of “green atoms.”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Atoms themselves are colorless, but they can be regularly
    spaced in such a way that they give off a stream of photons at a
    particular energy level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
    there are photoreceptors behind our retinas geared to absorb photons at a
    similar level, the photons are converted into distinctive neural impulses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>These are in turn registered by the mind, and we describe what we see
    as<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> green</i>.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Secondary attributes, real as they are, do
    not arise by necessity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Large
    objects are not necessarily made out of large atoms, rectangular objects do
    not derive their shape from rectangular atoms, nor must a stationary object
    contain stationary atoms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
    more obviously, striped objects are not painted with “striped atoms,”
    nor does the mind contain “intelligent atoms.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The
    qualities of individual atoms are generic and few—but in combinations they
    produce innumerable effects.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Opinions</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Having established the infallibility of
    the senses does not, however, put us on the path towards omniscience.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Sensory presentations are utterly reliable, but we must also
    recognize that they are not utterly <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">available</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Nothing in the universe produces sights, sounds, or smells that are
    accessible everywhere to everyone at every time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Objects of minute size or at remote distances may produce effects
    that are below our threshold of detection, rendering them invisible, silent,
    or odorless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even large objects
    nearby are regularly shielded from our eyes, ears, and noses by intervening
    barriers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only phenomenon
    in the universe which <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">is</i>
    omnipresent, <i> the void</i>, is intangible, thus producing no sensation of any
    kind.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Since we cannot broaden the range of our
    observations to penetrate every nook and cranny of the universe, we must
    make do with sweeping assessments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By
    this means, we form <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">opinions</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlike the staunch presentations, which are always true,
    opinions are a matter of contrivance—their veracity is contingent upon the
    ongoing testimony of sensory presentations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>This is the crux of Epicurus’ <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Canon</i>,
    and Sextus Empiricus extends us the courtesy of spelling out its articles:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="Citation" align="justify"><a name="TCE5"></a><font color="#000080">According
      to Epicurus, some opinions are true, some false.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>True opinions are those which are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">attested</i>
      by and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not contested</i> by clear
      facts, while false opinions are those which are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">contested</i>
      by and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not attested</i> by clear
      facts.</font></p>
      <p class="Citation" align="justify"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font color="#000080">Attestation</font></i>
      <font color="#000080">
      is perception through a self-evident impression, that the object of
      opinion is such as it once was thought to be—for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>example, if Plato<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>is approaching from far off, I form the conjectural opinion,
      owing to the distance, that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">he is
      Plato</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But when he has
      come close, there is further testimony that he is Plato, now that the
      distance is reduced, and it is attested by the self-evidence itself.</font></p>
      <p class="Citation" align="justify"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font color="#000080">Non-contestation</font></i>
      <font color="#000080">
      is the conformity between a non-evident thing which is the object of
      speculation, and the opinion about what is apparent—for example,
      Epicurus, in saying that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">void exists</i>,
      which is non-evident, confirms this through the self-evident fact of
      motion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For if void does not
      exist, there ought not be motion either, since the moving body would lack
      a place to pass into as a consequence of everything being full and solid.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the non-evident thing believed is not contradicted
      by that which is evident, since there is motion.</font></p>
      <p class="Citation" align="justify"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font color="#000080">Contestation</font></i><font color="#000080">,
      on the other hand, is opposed to non-contestation, for it is the
      elimination of that which is apparent by the positing of the non-evident
      thing—for example, the Stoic says that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">void
      does not exist</i>, being non-evident; but once this denial is put
      forward, then that which <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">is</i>
      evident, namely motion, ought to be co-eliminated with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>For if void does not exist, then motion does not occur either,
      according to the method already demonstrated.</font></p>
      <p class="Citation" align="justify"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font color="#000080">Non-attestation,</font></i>
      <font color="#000080">
      likewise, is opposed to attestation, for it is confirmation through
      self-evidence of the fact that the object of opinion is not such as it was
      believed to be—for example, if someone is approaching from far off, we
      conjecture, owing to the distance, that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">he
      is Plato</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But when the
      distance is reduced, we recognize through self-evidence that it is not
      Plato.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This sort of thing
      turns out to be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">non-attestation</i>.</font></p>
      <p class="Citation" align="justify"><font color="#000080">So attestation and
      non-contestation are the criterion of something’s being true, while
      non-attestation and contestation are the criterion of its being false.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>And self-evidence is the foundation and basis of all [four] of
      these.” </font>- Sextus Empiricus, <i>Against the Professors 7.211-216</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><a href="insights/3-2.html"><img border="0" src="insights/3-2t.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="5"></a>The principles of the Canon square up the
    cornerstones of empirical reasoning (click image at right to view diagram).&nbsp;
    We need not dwell upon method of direct observation—its obvious application can be summarized by a single well-known maxim:
    “seeing is believing.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
    when confronted by inconspicuous phenomena, we must resort to the method of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">inference—</i>its
    application is less obvious and deserves further explanation.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b> Methods of Inference</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Our principal source for elucidation is
    Philodemus of Gadara, an Epicurean philosopher and poet who resided in Italy
    after about 80 BC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A number of
    his writings have been found among the ruins of Herculaneum, an ancient
    resort town buried along with sister city Pompeii by the 79 AD eruption of
    Mt. Vesuvius.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the better
    preserved papyrus scrolls, designated <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">PHerc.
    1056</i>, has been assigned the title: “On Signs,” or alternatively,
    “On Methods of Inference.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    this polemical treatise, we find Philodemus defending the Epicurean <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">method
    of</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">analogy</i>—the procedure by
    which we may infer the qualities of things which happen to lie outside the
    range of perception.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In accordance with Philodemus’ doctrine,
    we may say that an incontestable analogy has the following constituents:</p>
    <p class="Citation" align="justify">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>An <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">agent,</i> which is
    something inconspicuous.</p>
    <p class="Citation" align="justify">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>An <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">attribute, </i>which is a
    quality that we suppose exists in the agent.</p>
    <p class="Citation" align="justify">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>An <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">analog,</i> which is
    something conspicuous that obviously embodies the attribute.</p>
    <p class="Citation" align="justify">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>A <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sign,</i> which is an obvious
    effect that is particular to the presence of the attribute.</p>
    <p class="Citation" align="justify">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>A hypothesized <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">exception, </i>which,
    by not occurring, affirms the particularity of the sign.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The analogy may be succinctly verbalized
    in the following format:</p>
      <blockquote>
    <p class="Citation" align="justify">[The agent], insofar as [it contains the
    attribute], [exhibits the particular sign] because no known [analog]
    [exhibits the exception].</p>
      </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The ancient Epicureans put the method of
    analogy to heavy use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some
    classic examples include arguments for the solidity of the atoms, the
    intangibility of the void, the mortality of men, and the porous nature of
    the human skin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence: atoms,
    insofar as they are bodies, are tangible, because no known body is
    intangible; the void, insofar as it is empty, allows motion, because no
    known empty place inhibits motion; all men, insofar as they are men, are
    mortal, because no known man has ever survived the thorough treatment of an
    executioner; the human skin, insofar as it is porous, allows the passage of
    sweat, because no known sieve inhibits flow of water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>These are examples of what Sextus Empiricus describes as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">non-contestation</i>.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The linchpin of the argument by analogy
    hinges upon the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">particular
    relationship</i> between the sign and the attribute—they must be
    inseparable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If not, then the
    analogy doesn’t hold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a
    case is said to be using a “common sign” rather than a “particular”
    one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For instance, it would be
    unwise to argue as follows: atoms, insofar as they are bodies, are colored,
    because no known body is colorless; the void, insofar as it is intangible,
    in non-existent, because no known existing thing is intangible; all men,
    insofar as they are rich, are good, because no known rich man is evil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>These arguments fail because each uses a common sign, made evident by
    an exceptional case: a body immersed in darkness does not produce color; a man who acquired
    his wealth by theft is evil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any
    assertion to the contrary would be subject to what Sextus Empiricus
    describes as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">contestation</i>—the elimination of something apparent.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Whether or not a particular analogy is
    valid, the method itself can always be rendered cogent—or in other words: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">the exception proves the rule</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>A common sign may be just as useful in exposing a falsehood as a
    particular sign is for revealing a truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Hence, an analogy may be stated in an alternative format—the form

        <p align="justify">If you have ever come across the
      term <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">fuzzy logic,</i> chances are that you saw or heard it used in connection
      with computer science or the latest in electronic gadgetry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Coined in 1964 by Azerbaijani-born American logician Lofti Zadeh, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">the</span>
        application of fuzzy-logic has been sudden and
      far-reaching: thermostats that regulate temperature more efficiency,
      braking systems that stop vehicles more smoothly, camcorders that track a
      steady frame in spite of a jittering operator, optical character readers
      that more accurately convert images of printed pages into electronic text,
      computer games in which automated opponents play more competitively, and
      investing strategies that allow program-traders to play the markets more
      profitably.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But although this
      “fuzzy revolution” is recent and technological, the ideas behind
      it are ancient and philosophical.</p>
      <p align="justify">Logic, as a formal discipline of deductive reasoning, is a
      product of the Hellenistic world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
      name is derived from the Greek <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">logos</i>,
      meaning “word,” and its inventor is traditionally—and perhaps
      rightly—regarded as Aristotle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
      this system, every entity in the universe is presumed to be a member of a
      distinct <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">category.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i>For instance,
      if Socrates is a man, he belongs to the category of all men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Categories can also be subdivided into smaller categories (if
      Socrates is bald, he belongs to the subset of bald men) and subsumed by
      larger ones (all men are people—so Socrates belongs to the
      superset of all people).</p>
    <p align="justify">Given the establishment of categories, Aristotle
      identified two axioms upon which the whole of his system rests: The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Law of Non-Contradiction</i> and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Law of the Excluded Middle</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      first of these can be expressed by the formula: “A cannot be both B and
      not-B (at the same time and in the same respect).”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>E.g.,
      “Socrates cannot be both a man and not a man.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The second law, which is a corollary of the first, purports that
      “A is either B or not-B.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; E.g., </span>
      “Socrates
      is either a man or not a man.”&nbsp; Hence,
      the structure of this logical system is<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
      bivalent</i>, meaning that every aspect of existence can be cleaved down
      to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

        e.g., “Philoctetes will be wounded” was true in all previous ages,

      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"><a name="TCE8"><font color="#000080"></font></a><font color="#000080">It is not good

        ethics, or in the solution of problems of natural philosophy.&nbsp; …
        We cannot act in the same way with respect to the heavenly phenomena,
        these productions may depend upon several different causes, and we may
        give many different explanations on this subject, equally agreeing with
        the impression of the senses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
        it is not here a question about reasoning on new principles, and of

        for the interpretation of nature; the only guides for us to follow are
        the appearances themselves. - </font>Epicurus, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Letter to
        Pythocles 85</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify">Epicurus goes on to postulate, for example, that the moon
      might be luminous, or illuminated by the sun; eclipses of the sun and moon
      may be due to self-induced lulls, or the juxtaposition of interposing
      bodies; the appearance of a “face” on the moon may be due to
      incidental surface features, or the interposition of an atmospheric
      disturbance; comets may appear and disappear because their constituent
      particles condense and dissipate at random, or perhaps because they move
      as a whole between places nearer and further from us; meteors may be
      detached pieces of stars, or they may be substances which are “set on fire
      by the action of the wind.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Epicurus
      also reminds Pythocles of the possibility that such causes may exist <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">in
      tandem</i> to bring about the phenomenon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>As it turns out, a modern astronomer would indeed testify that
      meteors are substances that do burn up on the atmosphere—lumps of iron
      which, moreover, did originate as chunks of exploding stars.</p>
      <p align="justify">For Epicurus, then, any hypothesis is admissible as long
      as it meets the aforementioned <i>criterion</i> of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">non-contestation</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Although each hypothesis is not regarded as being wholly <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">true</i>
      or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">false</i> when considered <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">individually</i>,
      they may <i> add up</i> to the truth when considered <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">collectively</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>By this means, the ancients could settle their minds on matters for
      which precise observation was not available, and still retain accuracy.</p>
      <p align="justify">Lucretius, in writing his poem on nature, followed
      Epicurus’ lead, in providing multiple explanations not only for the
      phenomena of the sky, but also for earthly curiosities such as why the
      Nile floods in the summer, what gives magnets their attractive power, and
      the possible causes of diseases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
      be fair though, Epicurus and Lucretius certainly did not always hit their
      mark, even with their “shotgun approach.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>For instance, they attributed the westward migration of heavenly
      bodies either to their motion through space, or because they were fixed
      upon a rotating firmament encasing the earth—but never because the stars
      were fixed in space surrounding a rotating earth; earthquakes were attributed to wind penetrating the earth, or to the
      absorption of external matter from outer space—but never to grinding of
      the Earth’s migrating crust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
      perhaps the most infamous oversight among ancient Epicureans was their
      assumption that the apparent sizes of celestial bodies do not diminish
      over distance, when in fact they do—albeit imperceptibly at terrestrial
      distances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In presuming that
      celestial imagery traveled in a laser-like <a name="parallel"></a>parallel
      fashion, they concluded that the sun, moon, and stars were “more or less
      the same size as they appear to be.” <a href="insights/4-3.html"><img border="0" src="insights/4-3t.gif" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="15"></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This attitude also brought upon the derisive criticism of
      Cicero—and we too might laugh loudly with him when he interprets this
      statement to mean that the sun must be just a foot across!&nbsp; (though we don't
      know of any Epicurean having gone on record saying so.)&nbsp; But take careful note of the nature of these errors: lack of
      contestation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not having a
      way to get much closer to the sky, or to probe the depths of the earth,
      what possible basis was there to contest the ancient Epicureans?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It took the invention of the telescope and the seismograph in order
      to reveal the surprising solutions we learn in our youth today.</p>
