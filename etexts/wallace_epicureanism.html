        </font>the Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, towards the close of the
        second century of our era, resolved to give Imperial sanction to the
        higher teaching of the Roman world by the state endowment of a
        philosophical professoriate, he found four schools or sects dividing the
        public favour and drawing in their several directions the best thought
        of the time. These schools were the school of Plato, known as the
        Academic; the school of Aristotle, known as the Peripatetic; the school
        of Zeno, known as the Stoic; and the school of Epicurus, known as the
        Epicurean. It was not without a cause that the fourth school continued
        to be known by the name of its founder, which it did not exchange like
        the others for an epithet drawn from some favourite locality. To the
        very close of its career the Epicurean sect clung reverently and
        lovingly to the person of the master, to whom, with one accord, his
        followers attributed their escape from the thraldom of superstition and
        of unworthy fears and desires. The member of another school might assert
        towards his teachers a certain impartiality of critical examination. If
        Plato and Socrates were dear to the Platonist, truth was dearer still.
        But to the Epicurean the belief in his characteristic doctrines was
        blended with, and humanized by, attachment to the memory of the founder
        of his creed.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of the four schools, two were more ancient than the
        others. The Academics and the Peripatetics preceded the Stoics and
        Epicureans by more than half a century; they continued to exist and
        flourish long after the younger sects had died away into silence. But
        during the four centuries which witnessed the rise and spread of
        Epicurean and Stoical doctrines, from B.C. 250 to A.D. 150, the two
        other schools were forced into the background, and abandoned by all but
        a few professed students. In the Roman world, the Stoic and Epicurean
        systems divided between themselves the suffrages of almost all who cared
        to think at all. Plato and Aristotle were almost unknown, for the two
        schools which professed to draw their original inspiration from these
        masters had rapidly drifted away from the definite doctrine of their
        leaders. The doctrine both of Plato and of Aristotle had been of a kind
        which, in modern times, we should term Idealism. It had been sustained
        by an enthusiasm for knowledge, and carried on by a great wave of
        intellectual energy. Plato and Aristotle gathered the ripe fruit from
        that Athenian garden where Pericles, Phidias, and Sophocles had visibly
        signified the spring-time of blossom and brightness. Strong in the
        accumulated strength of a century of Athenian power and splendour, they
        raised their eyes fearlessly upon the world, and tried to discover its
        plan and meaning as the home of humanity <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>the humanity which they saw
        around them and felt within them. They endeavoured to trace the steps in
        the long ladder of means and ends, which, from the analogy of what they
        saw in their types of human society, they believed would also be found
        in the natural world. They looked upon everything in nature and in
        humanity as the realization of an idea, as a stage in the unfolding of a
        ruling principle. Everything to Plato was the product of an &quot;idea
        of the Good&quot;; everything to Aristotle was a step in the development
        of the ends of an intelligent Nature. To exist, for both of them, meant
        to embody or to express an idea, or plan. At the summit of all things,
        the principle and centre of the phenomena of the human and the natural
        world, was a creative plan or intellect, always itself forth into
        activity, everlastingly productive, and consciously surveying and
        embracing its own several manifestations. The question as to the
        materials employed in order to carry out these plans, was noticed by
        these thinkers only as it served to illustrate the process of
        realization. At least, this is the case with Plato to a large degree, to
        a less degree with Aristotle.</p>
        <p align="justify">The point on which both schools originally laid most
        stress, next to their fundamental principle, was an analysis of the
        order and concatenation of existence as a reasonable and intelligent
        system. They fixed their attention on the connection of one idea with
        another, on the relation between one stage in the complex scheme of
        actual existence and another. To bring together and to divide, to see
        differences where they are concealed, and to find sameness between
        things different, to discriminate and connect kinds and classes, is,
        according to Plato, the main work of that discussion or conversation
        (dialectic) which is the true art of the philosopher. In other words,
        the point towards which his interest is converging, as distinct from the
        fields in which that interest is operative, is what a later age would
        describe partly as logic, partly as metaphysic. It is metaphysic, when
        the relations and connections under examination are supposed to be the
        real underlying relations in the existent objects of the world. It is
        logic, when these relations and connections are regarded as modes of our
        thought, the means or methods by which we as intelligent beings seek to
        comprehend and rationalize the objects of nature and art. So far as
        Plato is concerned, it is scarcely possible to say when we are in
        metaphysic and when we are in logic. The ideas which are the denizens of
        a logical heaven, which are the patterns embodied in nature, are in his
        own writings not quite cut off from the ideas which the mind entertains
        when it attains knowledge. But in Aristotle the distinction between
        logic (or, as he calls it, Analytic) and Metaphysics (or, as he terms
        it, Theology or the First Philosophy) has been accomplished. The latter,
        as well as the former, he in part inherits from Plato; but it is in
        logic that he is most original, and gives most substantial extension to
        the philosophic field. On another side, too, Aristotle carved out a
        course of his own. The physical universe had a double attraction for
        him. On one hand it presented itself to him under the aspect of a
        process of movement, a working-out in time and space of the same eternal
        principles and relations of being which had formed the topic of his
        metaphysics. Under this point of view, a somewhat abstract and
        metaphysical one, he treats existence, in those books which bear what
        seems to a modern reader the somewhat misleading title of &quot;Physical
        Lectures.&quot; But there is another side to Aristotle's interest in
        nature. In psychology, in natural history, and in his political studies,
        he is not merely a great metaphysician: he is a keen observer, and a
        laborious collector of facts. He enumerates, with all detail, the actual
        phenomena presented by experience, quite apart from the theoretical
        relations of the system under which they ought, from the other point of
        view, to range themselves.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus, in Plato and in Aristotle, there were warring
        tendencies. In Plato there is, on the one hand, the political and
        practical instinct which makes him a moral or educational reformer, and,
        on the other hand, the logical, or, to keep his own larger word,
        dialectical interest which impels him to criticise and to analyze, and
        to say that, &quot;the life to which criticism is denied is no life for
        man.&quot;<a href="#notes01"><u><sup>1</sup></u></a>&nbsp;
        In Aristotle, again, we see a constant wrestling of spirit between the
        ideal and metaphysical bent which is at home in the abstract forms of
        being, and the realistic sense which notices every detail in the
        operations of the rational mind and in the phenomena of animate nature,
        so as to assign to all minutiæ, even to the most degraded animals,<a href="#notes01"><u><sup>2</sup></u></a>
        their place in the ample collection of instances.</p>
        <p align="justify">The two schools which inherited the Academy of Plato
        and the Peripatos of Aristotle did not in either case carry off more
        than a fragment of their master's mantle. The Academic sect came more
        and more to give the reins to the critical, logical tendencies, which,
        in Plato himself, had been subordinated to his deep sense of the
        surpassing value of ethical ideas and the moral life. With the New
        Academy, as it is termed, the school of Arcesilaus and Carneades, every
        dogmatic tinge in the teaching had paled before the predominance of
        sceptical and critical polemic against other doctrines. The New Academy,
        inspired by the influence of its contemporary Pyrrho, the great
        sceptical philosopher of the ancient world, became the main arsenal
        where were forged the weapons of a universal destructive criticism.
        Such, in a mild form, was the attitude from which, for example, Cicero
        dealt with the dogmas of philosophy. It was the spirit which denies, the
        reason which rends in pieces its own constructions, that prevailed in
        the Academic school.</p>
        <p align="justify">The case was a little different with the Peripatetic
        school which immediately succeeded Aristotle. If Plato was not an
        Academic or Platonist, no more was Aristotle a Peripatetic. His
        immediate followers, Theophrastus and Strato of Lampsacus, soon left the
        metaphysical idealism of their master. The great principle of a cosmic
        reason, an intellectual deity at the head of all existence, was
        abandoned and neglected. The logical and the physical departments were
        made the predominant feature in the tradition of the school, and
        gradually usurped the place of metaphysical inquiries. The speculative,
        transcendental element in Aristotle was eliminated, and nothing left but
        &quot;positive&quot; science. Aristotelianism was thus like a cask which
        had its bottom knocked out: it collapsed into fragments. Strato of
        Lampsacus spoke no more of God, but only of nature, and practically set
        aside the distinction which Aristotle had drawn between the reason and
        the senses. In the next generation, Aristotelianism sank into greater
        stagnation; it became more positive and less philosophical; it passed
        into scholasticism, and put learning in the place of wisdom and
        research.</p>
        <p align="justify">A day, indeed, came when both Platonism and
        Aristotelianism entered on a new phase. In the early centuries of our
        era the writings of the two philosophers were made a text for
        philological study: they were interpreted, annotated, reconciled, and
        systematized by the commentators of the first six centuries, from
        Andronicus to Simplicius. But for our immediate purpose it is sufficient
        to remember that in the generation which succeeded Aristotle the
        Academic and Peripatetic schools no longer represented the mind of their
        founders. They became more and more exclusively intellectual, logical,
        and formal: the philosophers degenerated into professors and schoolmen.
        For the most part they taught something of logic and rhetoric. And the
        inability of the followers to sustain the idealism of their first chiefs
        led to a growth of sceptical and critical intellect. Philosophy ceased
        to be the serious enterprise which Socrates had made it. It was no
        longer the arbiter of life and conduct<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"> — </span>something than which, as Plato
        says &quot;no greater good came or will come to mortal race by the gift
        of the gods.&quot; It was now only a preliminary training which
        communicated the art of reasoning and the abstract principles of morals
        and legislation. It had become then indeed, what it has mainly become at
        the present day, a recognised part of the university curriculum, and
        nothing more.</p>
        <p align="justify">The great schools of Plato and Aristotle had in the
        hands of their successors declared themselves bankrupt. Idealism had
        apparently proved a failure. One by one the great ideal principles had
        been surrendered. Aristotle had attacked the transcendentalism of Plato:
        he was himself superseded by a more realistic doctrine; and in the
        period of general scepticism which set in like a flood the only thing
        that seemed worth cultivating was the little grammatical, philological
        or physiological knowledge that had been at that period collected. Amid
        the general dissatisfaction with the results to which thought, rising
        into the empyrean and tracing from an ideal standpoint the plan of the
        world, had led its adherents, there was in the air a desire for a new
        doctrine, a new moral panacea. This time the doctrine must be realist.
        If the old schools had been spiritualistic, the new doctrine must be
        materialistic. If the old schools had made thought and ideas all in all,
        the sole true existence, the new school must admit the existence of
        nothing which was not corporeal. Instead of reason, the new school must
        base everything on sensation. The old schools of Plato and Aristotle had
        gone boldly to work, confident in the strength of thought. The new
        schools must justify their starting point, and prove their foundation in
        the presence of a strong hostile force of sceptics.</p>
        <p align="justify">The circumstances of Greece, too, had changed greatly
        since Plato and Aristotle wrote. A period of petty republics, of a more
        or less aristocratic character, had been succeeded, since the conquest
        of central and southern Greece by the Macedonians, by a period of fusion
        and of confusion. The monarchical principle, which had established
        itself at the summit of the State, had not yet been able to organize
        itself in the details and connect itself with constitutional life. The
        city was not, as it had been in Plato's time, its own sovereign: its
        affairs were subject to the will of some foreign king, himself but
        insecurely seated on his throne, and acting more often as an instigation
        to evil-doing than as a hope to those who did well. The glory and charm
        of the old Greek political life in the service of those who were almost
        personal acquaintances had passed away. Political life in the Macedonian
        epoch was only possible either for those who had the courage to adopt
        and foster the wishes of their compatriots to regain their freedom, or
        for those who could dare the mistrust and enmity of their
        fellow-citizens by acting as the ministers of an alien despot. The first
        course was dangerous, and often unwise; the second was generally
        ignoble. All that was left for those who were neither disposed to suffer
        martyrdom as patriots, nor to court princely favours by a knavish
        submission, was to take part in the farce, as it had now become, of
        municipal government. But to undertake such a post might be performed as

        <p align="justify">The distance between the age of Plato and the age of
        Zeno and Epicurus, the founders of the two new sects which supplanted
        their predecessors, may be illustrated by the character of the comic
        plays, which found favour with either. The comedy of Aristophanes has
        for its scene the main resorts of the public political life of its time.
        It is a caricature of public men and public measures. Athens, with its
        foreign relations and its domestic politics, is the topic which
        reappears in a hundred shapes and drags into its compass even the
        inmates of the women's chamber and the characters and ideas of the
        public thinkers. In the new comedy of Menander and Philemon, public life
        is unknown. It is the family and the social aspects of life which are
        the perpetual theme. Instead of generals and statesmen, demagogues and
        revolutionaries, the new comedy presents a recurring story of young
        men's love affairs, and old men's economies, of swaggering captains and
        wily valets-de-chambre, hangers-on at rich men's tables and young women
        working mischief by their charms. The whole comedy turns on one aspect
        of domestic life<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        and brings the cook and the dinner-table prominently on the stage.</p>
        <p align="justify">In such a set of circumstances rose the systems of
        Stoicism and Epicureanism. Like all systems they were the products of
        their age, but not merely a product. They summed up and drew out the
        conclusions to which the past had furnished them with the premises; but
        by the very act of formulating the result, they gave it greater
        consistency and power. They helped men to see the ideals of life, which
        their circumstances were leading them, hesitatingly and imperfectly, to
        adopt.</p>
        <p align="justify">Already in the lifetime of Plato other disciples of
        Socrates had learned a different lesson from their common teacher. The
        self-reliant spirit of criticism and the independence of conventionality
        which marked Socrates had touched them more than his interest in all
        that was Athenian and his love for knowledge. Whilst to Plato and
        Aristotle the highest knowledge had been valued solely for its own sake
        and not as a means to any further end, to the thinkers of whom we now
        speak knowledge seemed worthy to be prosecuted only so far as it tended
        to produce a clear self-centred judgment, and to give some principle for
        the regulation of personal conduct. Those thinkers belong to two kinds.
        At the head of the one stood Antisthenes, the founder of a sect which
        came to be called Cynical, and of which the most noted member was
        Diogenes. At the head of the other stood Aristippus of Cyrene, from whom
        his followers have been called Cyrenaics.</p>
        <p align="justify">The foremost characteristic of these schools is their
        hostility to all conventions. They were outrageous realists. They
        disregarded and despised the follies of those who allowed themselves to
        be enthralled by the bands of opinion, of custom, fashion and
        conventional decorum. Aristippus was a man of the world, who shrank from
        the bonds of political life. He told Socrates that he was, and meant to
        be, a. stranger everywhere,<a href="#notes01"><u><font color="#0000FF"><sup>3</sup></font></u></a>
        free as the bird from all the burdens and privileges of citizenship,
        making himself everywhere at home, bound by no ties and no associations,
        enjoying each scene of life as it came with no thought of other times,
        and with butterfly-like lightness flitting to-morrow to other scenes and
        new delights. A life of pleasant and varied excitements, untroubled by
        any checks from fashion, morality or religion, was the ideal of
        Aristippus. He let others keep the political life going, and came in as
        occasion suited to enjoy the fruits of their labours. Antisthenes and
        Diogenes could scarcely be more cynical than Aristippus, but they showed
        their cynicism in another way. They, too, claimed independence as the
        chief good. But while Aristippus was a man of substance, they had no
        fortune or social position to fall back upon. Antisthenes was a poor
        man, who earned a living by teaching rhetoric. Of Diogenes and his tub
        everybody has heard. These men sought independence in renunciation and
        asceticism. Let a man learn how little he really needs, they said, and
        he will soon be master of his own welfare and superior to the caprices
        of fortune. What Aristippus with his buoyancy and versatility obtained
        in a round of pleasures, the Cynics sought in self-denial and the
        practice of endurance. Like Aristippus, they were indifferent to
        country: they professed themselves citizens of the world.</p>
        <p align="justify">During the times of Plato and Aristotle, doctrines
        like these were only in opposition, and even as an opposition they made
        but a slight figure. They were mainly a practical protest against the
        dominant tendency to sacrifice the individual to the community. They had
        and could have but little in the way of systematic doctrine. They live
        in the pages of the history of philosophy by the repartees of which the
        anecdotes about them are full. As is natural with those who protest
        against the exaggeration of a principle, they took up an exaggerated
        attitude themselves. Very soon the Cyrenaics found that a round of
        pleasures was likely to contradict its professed aim, and one of them
        Hegesias, swung round so far as to declare happiness impossible, and to
        suggest the desirability of death. As for the Cynics, they could never
        know where to stop in their asceticism: and were rightly reminded that
        so long as they failed to throw off their cloak and imitate the naked
        sages of India, they might be charged with luxurious habits.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was different when Stoicism and Epicureanism
        appeared. What had previously been the protest emphatically acted by a
        few, had now by the force of circumstances become the general position
        and drift of the world. A country to live and die for<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        existed for any one. More and more the old separations between cities
        were breaking down and the old jealousies were fading away. Athens had
        admitted many aliens within her walls. From Syria and Phoenicia, from
        Tarsus and Berytus, came strangers who soon made themselves at home. The
        successors of Alexander, by their changing alliances and continual wars,
        waged largely around Greece, the carcass over which these vultures
        hovered, introduced a kind of loose unity among the peoples on the
        eastern shores of the Mediterranean. The Hellenistic period began.</p>
        <p align="justify">In these circumstances, Zeno and Epicurus about the
        year 300 B.C. founded at Athens two new systems of philosophy. Almost
        from the beginning they were in opposition to each other, and the
        intensity of their opposition did not diminish during the five or six
        centuries while they subsisted side by side. But in certain important
        points in opposition to the doctrine of Plato and Aristotle they were at
        one. Both of them practically ignored the State, and struck away
        whatever influences interposed between the individual man and the
        ultimate springs of human actions.</p>
        <p align="justify">Both dealt with man solely as an individual, who can,
        if he thinks it desirable, make terms with society, but who has a prior
        and natural right to live and progress for himself. To the perfection or
        the happiness of the individual everything was made subordinate. A man's
        sole duties were, according to their view, towards himself.</p>
        <p align="justify">In pronouncing this decision, they carried to its
        further result that separation between the life of political or public
        activity and the life of studious search after truth, and that decided
        depreciation of the former which both Plato and Aristotle had sometimes
        suggested and sometimes expressed. But when they went further in this
        direction, and made the search for truth only a means to secure freedom
        from fears and passions, they presented a marked contrast to their
        predecessors. With the Stoics and Epicureans ethics is the end and goal,
        and an ethic moreover which looks only to the interests of the
        individual. To Plato and Aristotle morality was the elementary basis for
        a reasonable life<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:

        superstructure of science, and work for the welfare of his community and
        of the human kind. Such is the conception, for example, embodied in
        Plato <i>&quot;Republic.&quot;</i> But to the Stoics and Epicureans the
        main question was how each was to save his own soul, to secure his own
        independence and serenity, and to live his own life well and happily.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Stoics and Epicureans addressed themselves to the
        human being who, whatever may be his associations, is still at the root
        of his nature alone. They treated him as something which is an end in
        itself, not as a mere fragment of society. Like Christianity, they spoke
        to the human soul, stripped of most of its national and social
        disguises. They appealed to a wider public, and a more generically human
        interest than Plato or Aristotle. They spoke to the man, and not merely
        to the citizen <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        the whole man, and not merely to the reason. It was of these schools
        that Lord Bacon spoke when he said that the moral philosophy of the
        heathen world was a sort of theology to it. They really covered the same
        ground, at least in part, which is now taken up by religion.</p>
        <p align="justify">Both of them are in the main ethical systems, if by
        ethics we mean an attempt to discover what is the chief end of man, and
        how it can be attained. To that everything else was subordinated. It is
        in these schools, especially in the Stoic, that we first come upon the
        division of philosophy, afterwards so general, into three parts, an
        ethical, logical, and physical theory. The physical and the logical are
        for the sake of the ethical. And it is in these points that they
        especially differ from the Cyrenaic and Cynic schools. They proceed more
        systematically, and lay their foundations deeper. They do not scorn,
        especially the Stoics, to take a leaf out of the note-books of Plato and
        Aristotle. The Epicureans were all for practice, and opponents
        frequently derided them as illiterate and illogical. The Stoics, on the
        contrary, were pertinacious and somewhat pedantic logicians, to whom the
        scholastics really owed many of those logical subtleties which are
        commonly by mistake attributed to Aristotle. But in whatever way they
        sought it, the aim which both Stoic and Epicurean had in view in their
        logic was to reach certainty and reality. The question of the criterion,
        or how we can know whether our thoughts bring us to real existence or
        no, is a fundamental problem with them. And combined with this is a
        conviction common to both, that the real is the material, corporeal<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        </span>are perhaps the three points most conspicuously
        common to the two schools. When we look at their differences, we find
        that the Stoics were less opposed than their rivals to the general
        character of philosophic tradition and to the currents of public
        opinion. In fact, between the three schools of Plato, Aristotle, and
        Zeno, on the one hand, and Epicureanism on the other, there was a
        considerable interval. The three former had more of a scholastic and
        philosophical culture, and were more suitable instruments for training
        young pupils. The fourth school appealed to maturer but less educated
        characters.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Stoics, on the whole, supported the interests of
        the existing religious and social order. They held that a man ought,
        save in peculiar circumstances, to take an active part in public life
        and to found a family in the commonwealth. The saving clause, of course,
        may admit of a very wide interpretation. The majority of the school,
        too, tried to give a rationalized explanation of the popular mythology,
        and thus to justify the religious creed of their country.<a href="#notes01"><u><sup>4</sup></u></a><font size="1">&nbsp;</font>
        They accommodated themselves in these points to circumstances; but the
        perfect Stoic, or as he was still called, the Cynic, the ideal saint of
        the Stoical writers, rejected these modifications, and gave his whole
        life to preach and practise righteousness. Other characteristics of the
        Stoics lay in the conception of duty and obligation, which, at least
        among the Roman Stoics, came prominently forward amongst their minor
        morals; in the doctrine of man's dependence on the general order of the
        universe<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        <p align="justify">The Epicureans stood aloof from practice to a far
        greater extent than the Stoics. The end of their system looked to life,
        and not to business: the end of their wisdom was to enjoy life. They did
        not profess, like the Stoics, that their wise man was capable of doing
        well any of the innumerable vocations in life which he might choose to
        adopt. They claimed that he would live like a god amongst men and
        conquer mortality by his enjoyment at every instant of an immortal
        blessedness. While the Stoic represented man as the creature and subject
        of divinity, the Epicurean taught him that he was his own master. While
        the Stoic rationalized the mythology of their country into a crude and
        fragmentary attempt at theology, the Epicurean rejected all the legends
        of the gods and denied the deity any part in regulating the affairs of
        men. Both agreed in founding ethics on a natural as opposed to a
        political basis. But they differed in their application of the term
        nature. To the Stoic it meant the instinct of self-conservation <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        the full all that the conditions of human life permit.</p>
        <p align="justify">These were the main schools of ancient philosophy.
        But there were other schools, or at least other names of philosophical
        opinion, current in the early days of the Roman Empire. One of these,
        and the longest-lived of all, was Pythagoreanism. Like Epicureanism, it
        had a semi-religious character; it clung to the name of its founder, and
        maintained a long tradition. But it was very unlike the latter in the
        poetical and fantastic character of its doctrine, in its proneness to
        superstition. About the first century after Christ it was brought into
        renewed fame by the alleged miracles and superhuman wisdom of Apollonius
        of Tyana, and from that time onwards it continued to exert a great, if a
        not very beneficial influence on the progress of ancient philosophy and
        religion. Lastly, there were a few Sceptics, those nomads of the
        philosophical world,<a href="#chapter01"><u><sup>5</sup></u></a>
        who disdain all persistent culture of the soil, and hover round the
        hosts of dogmatic thinkers, seeking to cut off their squadrons in detail
        by the manœuvres of a minute and captious criticism.</p>
                <p align="justify">Let it be remembered in all cases that to the
                ancients, philosophy was no trifling, merely intellectual
                pursuit. &quot;Philosophy,&quot; says Seneca,<u><sup><a href="#notes01">6</a></sup></u>&quot;
                is not a theory for popular acceptance, and aiming at display.
                It is not in words, but in deeds. Its vocation is not to help us
                to spend time agreeably, or to remove ennui from our leisure: it
                moulds and fashions the mind, sets an order in life, directs our
                actions, points out what ought to be done and to be left undone;
                it sits at the helm and guides the course when the voyager is
                perplexed by dangers on either hand. Without it none can live
                undauntedly, none securely: every hour there occur countless
                things which call for counsel, and counsel can only be found in
                philosophy. Some one will say: 'What good can philosophy do me,
                if fatalism be true? What good can philosophy do me, if God
                directs the world? What does it avail, if chance is in chief
                command? For what is fated cannot be changed, and against
                uncertainties no preparation is possible. Either God has
                anticipated my purposed plan and settled what I am to do, or 
                chance leaves my plan no room.' Be each of these, or all of them
                together, true, I reply, philosophy is our duty: whether destiny
                constrains by an inexorable law, or God is judge of the universe
                and settles its order, or chance irregularly impels and
                confounds the affairs of man, philosophy ought to be our
                safeguard. It will encourage us to obey God willingly, to obey
                fortune without yielding; it will teach to follow God, to put up
                with chance.&quot;</p>

        and Epicurean sects were contemporaries. Zeno, the founder of Stoicism,
        was a native of the town of Citium, in Cyprus, and was born about the
        year 359 B.C. He died in 267, at the ripe age of ninety-two. Epicurus
        was born in 341 B.C., seven years after the death of Plato, and almost
        twenty years before the death of Aristotle. He died in 270 B.C., at the
        age of seventy-one. For more than thirty years Zeno and Epicurus were
        fellow-citizens of Athens, during the period of their manhood and old
        age. And yet their paths never met, they moved in different orbits. The
        founder of the Stoic school was a public and popular character. The King
        of Macedon looked up to him as to a master and a conscience, and the
        people of Athens not merely evidenced their faith in him by putting the
        keys of their city into his veteran hands, but publicly decreed him the
        honours of a golden crown and a national entombment, in consideration of
        the character of his life and teaching. Very different was the lot of
        Epicurus. He and his friends lived in quiet, unostentatious privacy.
        They were barely heard of by the mass of their contemporaries. Kings and
        commonwealths belonged to another order of things, removed from their
        interests and sympathies.</p>

        <p align="justify">Epicurus was the son of Neocles and Chærestrata. The name of his
        father, being the same as that of the father of the great statesman
        Themistocles, suggested a couplet of the poet Menander where he
        contrasts the son of Neocles who freed his country from slavery, with
        him who freed it from foolishness. The precise spot where Epicurus was
        born <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        Athenian, and belonged in particular to the little village or Dêmos of
        Gargettos, about seven miles northeast of Athens. But it is most
        probable that he first saw the light in the island of Samos. In the year
        365, twenty-four years before the birth of Epicurus, the Athenian
        general Timotheus had attacked Samos, which was then hostile to Athens
        and acting in the interests of the Persians. After the conquest of the
        island, several of the natives who belonged to the hostile party were
        expelled by the general, and their lands were assigned to Athenian
        colonists,<a href="#notes02a"><u><sup>1</sup></u></a> who,
        it appears, gradually encroached upon their neighbours, till there was
        scarcely one of the original landholders left. Among the Athenians who
        sought to better their fortune in Samos were the parents of Epicurus.
        For Athens had lost the commercial and maritime supremacy in the Levant,
        for which she had struggled a century before in the Peloponnesian war, and still more recently in
        the year 378. By the middle of the fourth century, B.C. 355, she was
        forced to surrender her claims to the mastery of the seas. The island of
        Rhodes on the southeast, and the town of Byzantium to the northeast of
        the Ægean Sea, became the main seats of commercial activity.</p>
        <p align="justify">There was great depression both in the public and private finances of
        Athens, and the opportunity of finding relief in a colony was too
        tempting to be resisted. Neocles, the father of Epicurus, was one of two
        thousand Athenians who hoped to find an allotment of land in the island
        of Samos<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        was not in a brilliant position. According to the gossip of a later day,
        the youthful Epicurus was his father's assistant in the school, and
        helped to prepare the ink for the use of the pupils. But if the function
        of elementary teacher was attributed to the father, even less creditable
        was the vocation assigned by rumour to the mother of Epicurus. She was a
        minister in the service of foreign superstitions, of a church or chapel
        unauthorized by public or national establishment. Regarded half as a
        witch or sorceress, and half as a deaconess in a dubious conventicle of
        low and probably superstitious worshippers, she was no doubt scarcely a creditable parent in the eyes of the
        world. And at these rites, too, Epicurus was present as a boy helping
        his mother.<a href="#notes02a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

        The friends of Epicurus on the other hand, laid some stress on his
        descent from the Philaidæ, the family from which Pericles too had
        sprung. Both statements may have some truth in them. If one stops at the
        right place in genealogy, a creditable ancestry is always obtainable.
        And, on the other hand, it is not inconceivable that even in boyhood
        Epicurus was placed in antagonism to the dominant aristocracy of his
        time, no less in his religious associations than in his social
        circumstances. We know enough of Greek history in this period to be
        aware that the national gods had formidable rivals in a number of
        foreign deities, mainly of Oriental origin. In the port of Athens, in
        Rhodes, and other commercial centres, the existence of religious
        societies is revealed to us by the monumental stones which preserve the
        record of their constitution, the duties of their members, and scattered
        incidents in their history.<a href="#notes02a"><sup>3</sup></a> Very
        probably these were haunts of superstition; but they were also guilds

        ceremonial and festivity in these small chapels and more limited
        congregations, where they had a temple-worship and a litany of their
        own. Epicurus from his birth was outside the pale within which national
        idiosyncrasy and political pride confined their religious and their

        an examination, which in older days had been intended to test the
        qualifications of the candidate to sustain his post in the national
        army, but was probably now little more than a form, he was
        &quot;confirmed&quot; as an aspirant citizen. On that occasion he took

        college friend, was the great poet of the New Comedy, Menander. In later
        days the period of novitiate between the eighteenth and the twentieth
        year was a time when the young Ephêbi enjoyed the privileges and
        submitted to the restraints of a sort of student and college life. But it was probably not as yet customary to give to
        the period of opening manhood a training so predominantly intellectual
        as it came to be in the early centuries of our era.<a href="#notes02a"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;
        And, at any rate, the times were evil. In 323 B.C., when
        the news of Alexander the Great's death was wafted to Greece, the
        Athenians, in the restless spirit which often had led them to glory,
        took up arms to recover their own independence and to liberate Greece
        from Macedonian rule. The troops which Alexander had disbanded on the
        completion of the conquest of Persia had gathered in great numbers at
        Taenarum, in the south of the Peloponnesus; and the money which Harpalus,
        a runaway viceroy of Alexander's, had brought to Athens, easily enabled
        the Athenians to equip from these warriors, impatient for employment, a
        force sufficient for the moment to paralyze Antipater, who held
        Macedonia in the interest of the &quot;kings,&quot; the sons of
        Alexander the Great. But in no long time Antipater, whom the vigorous
        outburst of the war had shut up in the town of Lamia, in the south of
        Thessaly, was able to resume the offensive with his reinforcements; and
        in the year 322: B.C., the seaport-heights of Munychia and the Piræus,
        the harbour-forts of Athens, were garrisoned by Macedonian troops.</p>
        <p align="justify">Nor was this all. The regent of the Empire and administrator of the
        young princes, acting on the advice of Antipater, determined to break the insurrectionary spirit
        of the Athenian democracy. The civic franchise was restricted to those
        who had property to the amount of at least two thousand drachmæ: and it
        was openly suggested to the poor disfranchised Athenians that it might
        be well for them to seek their fortune in the towns lately founded by
        Macedonian kings on the coast of Thrace. More than half of the existing
        citizens seem to have been thus exiled. And Athens, restored to only a
        communal or municipal independence, was left in the control of the
        propertied and aristocratic classes, who loved peace and so were well
        content with the supremacy of Macedon. But Perdiccas, the administrator
        of the young princes, and Antipater went further. They restored Samos
        from the possession of Athens to its old proprietors, who had been
        banished from their native island more than forty years: and the
        Athenian settlers were forced to quit the ground they had usurped, and
        seek a refuge on other shores.<a href="#notes02a"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

        seem to have found some difficulty in fixing on a home. Colophon and
        Teos are two places mentioned as their abodes:<a href="#notes02a"><sup>7</sup></a>
        the former is said to have been the spot where Epicurus
        found his father on his return from Athens. Colophon not long before was
        the home of a lyric poet of some note, Hermesianax, who gave to three books of his odes the name of Leontion,
        his lady-love: a name which will afterwards recur in the history of
        Epicurus. Whether the lady of Hermesianax was also the lady of Epicurus
        is one of those questions which are apparently unanswerable, and
        probably for that reason excite the curiosity of a leisured fancy and
        afford ample ground for the grave disquisitions of philologists. Nor do
        we know how long Epicurus stayed in Colophon or Teos. At any rate, we
        know that about his thirtieth year he was temporarily settled at
        Mitylene, in the island of Lesbos. And it was at Mitylene that he first
        came forward as a recognised philosopher.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of his apprenticeship to philosophy we have but scanty hints. It was
        told by his friends that the future philosopher had betrayed himself
        even in his schoolboy days. As he read the <i>&quot;Theogony&quot;</i>
        of Hesiod with his tutor, he stumbled at the line which told how the
        origin of all things was from chaos. &quot;But what,&quot; asked the
        young Epicurus, &quot;was the origin of chaos?&quot; The teacher, who
        did not profess anything beyond grammar, naturally declined to solve the
        difficulty, and recommended Epicurus, it is said, to consult the
        professors of philosophy.<sup><a href="#notes02a">8</a>&nbsp; </sup>His
        chief teachers in that department are said to have been Nausiphanes, a
        Democritean of Teos, and Pamphilus, a Platonist of Samos.<a href="#notes02a"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">Of Nausiphanes, fortunately, we have some slight record. He seems to have taught at Teos, a place which on the
        collapse of the Ionic revolt (about 494 B.C.) had been brought into very
        intimate relations with Abdêra, the native city of the philosopher
        Democritus, the founder of the Atomic School. But Nausiphanes, though
        styled a Democritean, had had for his immediate master a man rather
        different from Democritus.<a href="#notes02a"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;
        This
        was Pyrrho of Elis, the noted Sceptic of antiquity. But it is somewhat
        misleading to term him a sceptic, in the modern sense of that term. He
        had seen the revolutions of Greek philosophy from Plato and Aristotle to
        their followers; he had accompanied the army of Alexander the Great to
        India, and had learned the falsity of much in dogmatic philosophy, and
        the uncertainty of much that seems fixed in morals. The lesson taught by
        Pyrrho intellectually was suspension of judgment; morally, it was
        imperturbability. &quot;Whoever desires to attain true happiness,
        must,&quot; said Pyrrho, &quot;find an answer to the three following
        questions.<a href="#notes02b"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp; What
        is the constitution of things? What ought to be our attitude towards
        them? And, lastly, What will be the consequence to those who adopt this
        right attitude?&quot;&nbsp; The first question we cannot answer, and therefore
        in the second place we must simply reserve our judgment and refuse to
        fix anything absolutely. We can only say: 'Probably,' and 'It seems so.'
        In this way we attain an undisturbed repose of mind. Such a scepticism, if it checks curious questioning, does not disturb our
        practical life: we can continue to act, though we act only according to
        probabilities.</p>
        <p align="justify">Pyrrho himself wrote nothing, and those who were curious to know
        something of the doctrines of one whose fame was widely spread had to
        seek their information from his pupils. Such were Timon and Nausiphanes:
        and the latter used to relate in later years how Epicurus had again and
        again questioned him about the habits and tenets of the great sceptic.<a href="#notes02b"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;
        But Epicurus could hardly have been in the ordinary sense
        a pupil of Nausiphanes; he must indeed have been rather older than his
        alleged master. Nausiphanes, however, it seems, claimed him as a
        disciple, much to the annoyance of Epicurus, who acknowledges that he
        did occasionally drop into the lectureroom of the &quot;Mollusc&quot; as
        he calls him, and found him expounding his doctrines to a few bibulous
        lads. And from all that one can learn about Epicurus, it is plain that
        he could not have been much of any man's pupil. He claims that he was
        self-taught; and that was in the largest sense true. That the
        contemporary philosophy did not influence him, it would be absurd to
        maintain; but his acquaintance with it was evidently confined to the
        main doctrines, in which it was popularly recognised. Where he did read
        was in the now perished writings of the philosophers anterior to Plato
        and Aristotle; for these last, in the main, he simply ignored. From
        Democritus he directly or in directly gained his physical theories; and a good authority informs
        us that his favourite philosophers were two of these pre-Socratic
        speculators, Anaxagoras, and Archelaus, the so-called teacher of
        Socrates.<a href="#notes02b"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp; What he found in them to admire we can only guess: probably the physical and
        mechanical explanation of the universe and of man, in which Anaxagoras
        seems. to have abounded. At Mitylene disciples gathered round him; and
        at Lampsacus, a ferry-town on the Dardanelles opposite to the modern
        town Gallipoli (the city of Callias), where he spent another year or
        two, he gradually became a recognised head of a philosophic school. He
        came, says an ancient writer, to look upon Lampsacus almost as his
        country.<a href="#notes02b"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp; The best of its inhabitants became his friends: particularly Idomeneus, and
        Leonteus with his wife Themista, Polyænus and Metrodôrus; and the
        friendships then formed lasted through life. In later days he kept up a
        correspondence with them, as with the philosophers at Mitylene; and
        twice or thrice crossed the sea to visit the scenes where disciples
        first believed in him. If Athens was the Mecca of this prophet,
        Lampsacus was his Medina.</p>
        <p align="justify">In 307 B.C. Epicurus settled in Athens. Since he had left it, in 322,
        its fortunes had not been brilliant, but they had given it tranquillity.
        In the year after the death of Antipater, in 319, it had been for a
        while drawn into the whirlpool of Macedonian politics.</p>
        <p align="justify">Enticed by the promises of Polysperchon, who hoped to enlist the
        democratic passions of the Greek cities on his side, Athens rushed from
        one political extreme to another. The violent reaction was not
        accomplished without bloodshed. Old Phocion and his conservative
        associates in the Macedonian interest fell a victim to fanatical and
        patriotic republicans, who doubted the honesty of his cautious policy.
        He and his friends were executed as traitors. But the hopes then
        encouraged of a renewal of Athenian sovereignty in Greece were soon
        disappointed. In 318, Athens was at the mercy of Cassander: and that
        prince, who not long afterwards made himself undisputed master of
        Macedon by the assassination of all the seed-royal of Alexander,
        continued to hold the city tight in his hands by means of the Macedonian
        garrison in the ports. From 318 to 307, the practical ruler of Athens
        under the Macedonian king was Demetrius of Phalerum. Under his
        government the city enjoyed considerable material prosperity: commerce
        flourished, and the three hundred and sixty statues which are reported
        to have been erected throughout Attica in honour of Demetrius himself
        are a proof that art was not neglected. Demetrius was at once a scholar
        and a man of the world.<a href="#notes02b"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp; In early life it is said he had exhibited the simplicity of a hermit in his
        fare of island cheese and pickled olives. But prosperity apparently
        changed him: he became a beau, devoting art and time to elaborating his personal appearance,
        and did not scruple to give free play to his sensual proclivities. Under
        such a <i>Régime</i> public morality and spirit necessarily
        deteriorated. The fashionable philosopher of the period was a pupil of
        Aristotle, Theophrastus, the friend of Cassander and of Ptolemy. Two
        thousand disciples, it is said, flocked to hear his lectures.<a href="#notes02b"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Even more vehement was the attraction exercised by
        Stilpon, of Megara, when he visited Athens: the very workmen flocked
        from their workshops and ran to look at him.</p>
        <p align="justify">Probably, however, with all these disadvantages, Athens may have
        seemed to some a more desirable residence than most of the Greek towns.
        Its old glories still won for it occasional reverence from the
        potentates of Asia and Egypt. In most of the other communities of Greece
        revolution was in permanence. Each party, as it gained the supremacy, in
        its turn massacred the prominent members of the opposition. Tyrants in
        name or in reality; foreign adventurers in search of power or pleasure;
        mercenary troops with no national ties and no respect for law, morality,
        or religion; exiles saturated with the gathered hatred of years: these
        and such like inflammable materials throughout Greece made the life of a
        peaceful inhabitant impossible. With no security for life and property,
        poverty and lawlessness spread apace; and the young not unfrequently
        grew up indifferent to their country, sceptical of their religion, bent
        upon enjoyment, and seasoning sensuality with a dash of literary and
        philosophic cultivation. Such, in its worst aspects, was Greece in the
        beginning of the 3rd century B.C. One fact alone may tell of the misery
        of the time. In the year 308, a Cyrenean adventurer advertised his
        intention of leading a horde across the deserts against Carthage, which
        was then staggering under the blows of another adventurer of great
        ability and greater unscrupulousness, Agathocles, the despot of
        Syracuse. Numbers of Athenians and other Greeks joined the enterprise.
        For, says the historian, the ceaseless wars and rivalry of princes had
        brought all Greece low and made it feeble, so that men not merely looked
        to an expected good fortune, but were influenced by the prospect of
        release from their present ills.<a href="#notes02b"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">The arrival of Epicurus in Athens in 307 was almost simultaneous with
        a change in the situation of Athens, by which the city was more openly
        involved in the wars between the successors of Alexander. Each of them
        hoped to win Athens to his side. The material support which she could
        render was indeed small, but the intellectual <i>prestige</i> of her
        name was a tower of strength for her friends. Macedonia had hitherto
        held her in tutelage by means of Demetrius of Phalerum. In 307, he was
        forced to abandon the city and flee to Egypt, before the attack of
        another Demetrius, the Besieger (<i>Poliorcêtes</i>), the son of
        Antigonus. Antigonus had made himself one of the most potent of the generals, who, after Alexander's death, gradually
        dared, in name as in fact, to divide his empire among themselves. From
        his seat of government in Phrygia he kept-up an incessant and generally
        successful system of encroachment upon his neighbours, Ptolemy in Egypt,
        Seleucus in Babylon, and Lysimachus in Thrace. His son, Demetrius, is
        one of the most remarkable characters in the age of Epicurus. In him was
        combined the intellectual ingenuity of the Greek with the despotic
        sensuality of an Oriental sultan. He seems to have been possessed by a
        genuine enthusiasm for Athens.</p>
        <p align="justify">Athens, restored to nominal liberty by the young Demetrius, fell into
        an intoxication of flattery. Demetrius and his father were proclaimed
        kings: they were worshipped as the &quot;gods and saviours&quot; of the
        state; a priest for their godheads' service was yearly appointed; their
        images were woven on the great veil of the Parthenon amongst the
        pictures of the other gods; two new tribes were formed and named after
        the liberating kings; one of the months (Munychion) had its name changed
        to Demetrion; and the last day of the month was styled Demetrias.<a href="#notes02b"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;
        But perhaps the best evidence of the worship and fetes
        which attended Demetrius in Athens is an ode or hymn sung, on one
        occasion, in his honour. &quot;For other gods,&quot; it says, &quot;are
        either far away, or have no ears to hear, or are not at all, or have no
        mind or care of us whatever: but thee we see before us, no god of wood or stone, but a real god and true.&quot;<a href="#notes02b"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;
        This burst of devotion to their saviour, whilst it shows
        the degradation of religious feeling and the lapse of the national
        faith, and whilst it is a bitter accusation against the rule of the
        Macedonian, proves also how completely the old spirit of Athens had
        sunk, and how hopeless was its political regeneration.</p>
        <p align="justify">But the relief from Macedonian occupation was not lasting. Demetrius
        was called away by the other engagements of his father's policy, and
        Athens had to sustain, unaided, a combat with the King of Macedon. It
        was, probably, at this time that a curious incident in the history of
        philosophical teaching took place. The democracy, which was now in
        power, looked with suspicion on the philosophers, who were mostly
        conservative in their sympathies, and who, at least the Peripatetics,
        were attached to the Macedonian rule. Accordingly, a law was passed
        forbidding any one, under pain of death, from opening a philosophic
        school without the consent of the supreme council and people.
        Theophrastus, and, probably, other philosophers, rather than comply with
        the order, left the city: but Athens was too dependent on her schools,
        or the Macedonian party soon raised its head; at any rate, the law was
        repealed next year, and the offended philosophers returned to their
        schools.<sup><a href="#notes02b">20</a></sup></p>
        <p align="justify">At Athens Epicurus purchased a house and garden. The former, at
        least, was in the quarter of the city known as Melité, the elevated
        southwestern district between the
        Acropolis and the Piæus. This garden was the head-quarters of the
        friends of Epicurus when they visited Athens, and became the hearth and
        home of the school which gathered round him. If we could believe one
        account of the matter derived from an author<a href="#notes02b"><sup>21</sup></a>
        who depended too much on compilations from books, one
        might fancy Epicurus and his company settled in a town-house with a
        garden around it, introducing into ancient life a sweet odour of the
        country, and anticipating the coming of a time when cities would no
        longer be fortresses, but blossom out. into a variegated scene of roofs
        embowered in leaves. That such a custom came in as the peace of the
        Roman Empire encompassed a larger sphere is well known; and if Epicurus
        did surround his home with a garden, he did what seems to have been done
        before his time. But one does not feel certain that the house and the
        garden were contiguous: on the contrary, the reverse, as we shall see,
        is probably, the truth. We are told that the garden cost eighty minæ, <i>i.e.</i>
        about £320; but the information scarcely enables us to fix the size of
        the property.</p>
        <p align="justify">For a period of about thirty-six years Athens was the home of
        Epicurus. He never during that time took part in public life, never
        solicited those municipal posts which were open to the ambitious. A
        calm, unostentatious life devoted to study of the nature of the world
        and morality, and enlivened by the companionship of like-minded men and women, and by correspondence with those who, in
        other places, were aiming at the same ends, was the life of Epicurus. In
        thus standing aside from the business of the commonwealth he ran counter
        to the teaching of some earlier philosophers, though not, perhaps, to
        the practice either of Plato or Aristotle. But the altered situation
        ought to be taken into account. The Athens of his time was no longer a
        sovereign state, ruling imperially over the islands of the Archipelago,
        nor was it the mere municipality which it afterwards became under the
        Roman Empire. Public life in such ambiguous circumstances was unreal and
        deceptive. The real springs of political force were to be found in the
        diplomatic intrigues of royal courts. Accordingly Epicurus, like
        Socrates before him, preferred to stand away out of the giddy whirl of
        politics, and devoted his best efforts to give a simpler and more
        natural tone to the aims and aspirations of individual life. It scarcely
        needs any argument to show that in such a season he chose the better
        part. In this time of instability, to act beneficially through the
        medium of politics, was only possible for a king or potentate possessing
        the rare desire to ameliorate and humanize his people. But men out of
        power could still show:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">How small of all that human hearts endure,<br>
          That part which laws or kings can cause or cure.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="justify">In religious matters Epicurus was not a dissenter from the national
        faith. He worshipped the gods of his community and his age, and took
        part in the observance of religious services and of festival pageantry. So, too,
        he instituted services to commemorate the names of some of his beloved
        dead. From neither the dead nor the gods did he expect any reward. But
        to both he felt an overflowing of a full heart, gladly showing forth in
        act its sense of fellowship and kindred with the august and distant gods
        and the near and dear departed. We are told with pride, too, by
        Philodêmus, the contemporary of Cicero, that Epicurus was never
        molested by the comic poets<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">—</span>never banished or put to death as an
        atheist and infidel.<a href="#notes02b"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp; Philodêmus
        was, no doubt, thinking of Socrates; but he hardly realized how
        different Athens was in the two periods, and how very great was the
        contrast between Socrates, freely discussing on the streets and squares,
        with all comers, on all topics, and Epicurus conversing quietly with his
        friends in his garden.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus tranquilly passed these thirty-six years in Athens. The position
        of Epicurus was very unlike that of his contemporaries in philosophy.
        Some of them like Zeno, the Stoic, and the heads of the Peripatetic
        school, Theophrastus, Strato, Lyco, and Demetrius were on terms of
        friendship and familiarity with the princes and great men of the time.
        It was not a rare or surprising event to see philosophers acting as the
        ambassadors of their native state, in its transactions with foreign
        powers. Thus Menedêmus, of Eretria, was entrusted by his
        fellow-citizens with the plenipotentiary disposition of their town; he was sent on
        embassies to foreign kings, such as Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Demetrius;
        and the young king of Macedonia was proud to subscribe himself as his
        pupil. Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt had been a scholar of Strato of
        Lampsacus. And Arcesilaus, the Platonist, though he declined the efforts
        made to get him to meet the King of Macedon, was an intimate friend of
        the captains or governors who held garrison in the Piræus, and stood
        well with Eumenes, the son of Philetærus.<a href="#notes02c"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">Another class of philosophers established themselves in the favour of
        the successors of Alexander on less equal terms than those claimed by
        the chiefs of Platonism and Aristotelianism. Men like Theodôrus, the
        witty Cyrenaic, and Crates the Cynic, with his Cynic wife, Hipparchia,
        made themselves regarded as an acquisition at the kingly courts by their
        powers of repartee, and the reputation of their <i>bons mots</i>. Their
        jests at the orthodox beliefs and their unblushing disregard of
        conventional standards, perhaps increased the piquancy of their company.
        Thus, when Stilpo was asked by Crates if the worship and offerings of
        the faithful gave the gods any satisfaction, he only replied by saying
        that the question was one not to be asked on the highway, but when they
        were alone. Another of these scoffers, Bion of Borysthenes, acquired
        quite a reputation by his religious indifference, though when sickness
        visited him he sought relief in the use of amulets, and abjured all the
        errors of his tongue. The court of Lysimachus, prince of Thrace, seems
        to have been a favourite resort of emancipated free-thinkers, both male
        and female. Hipparchia, the Cynic, and Theodôrus, the Cyrenaic and
        professed atheist, sometimes met there. Theodorus was the typical
        representative of the advanced thinkers of the time. He professed open
        contempt for the popular theology; he was a thorough cosmopolitan; and
        morality he regarded as one of those conventions which the elect spirits
        of society might treat as past and obsolete, for all but the
        narrow-minded Philistines and <i>bourgeoisie</i>. Before kings and
        people he was equally careless of his language. Athens was shocked at
        his open irreligion, and Mithras, the chamberlain of King Lysimachus,
        had to call him to account for his want of respect.<a href="#notes02c"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">While it continued to be the chosen home of Epicurus and his
        followers, Athens passed through a series of vicissitudes. Demetrius
        Poliorcêtes, its liberator from the Macedonian yoke, had been forced
        to withdraw his help, and as soon as he had gone, Cassander, the king of
        Macedon, renewed his efforts to impose his supremacy upon Athens. But in
        the hour of their peril the Athenians cried aloud for help to their
        former saviour, and in 303 B.C. Demetrius re-appeared in the Athenian
        territory, and succeeded in driving the Macedonian armies to the north
        of the pass of Thermopylae. In consequence of this relief, the Athenians were reckless with delight, and their gratitude found
        vent in a shameful servility. The Parthenon, the temple of the maiden
        goddess, was in part assigned to the prince as a lodging, and there for
        a short time he kept up a succession of imperial revelries with his
        mistresses and the <i>artistes</i> of his court. But these hours of
        intoxication were soon followed by a terrible awakening. In 301. B.C.
        Demetrius and his father succumbed under the combined attack of the
        other &quot;kings,&quot; as the successors of Alexander had lately come
        to style themselves. After the battle of Ipsus, in which Antigonus lost
        his life, Lysimachus became master of both sides of the sea of Marmora,
        and Demetrius found that the Athenians were not disposed to afford him
        any shelter or aid in his misfortunes. Athens, with the general
        selfishness of the age, declared itself neutral, and proceeded to
        rearrange its own affairs. But this was now in reality impossible. Where
        the aims of those who dreamed of maintaining for Athens an independent
        existence and policy clashed with the interests of the adherents of the
        Macedonian power and of those who supported the plans of other princes,
        faction was inevitable; and about 297 B.C. Athens fell into the hands of
        a popular chief, called Lachares. This man is described by an ancient
        writer as of all tyrants known the most savage towards men and the most
        unscrupulous towards God.<a href="#notes02a"><sup>25</sup></a> Demetrius
        Poliorcætes, now that Cassander was dead, determined again to try to get a footing in Athens. He invested the city by sea and land,
        and cut off all provisions from the inhabitants. A dreadful famine in
        the city was the consequence; the necessaries of life began to fail. A
        bushel of salt sold for twenty shillings, and for a peck of wheat people
        were willing to pay more than ten pounds. In one house a father and son
        were sitting in moody despair: suddenly a dead mouse fell from the roof,
        and the two wretched creatures sprang up and fought over the tiny prey.
        Epicurus and his companions managed to subsist on beans, counted out in
        equal numbers to each member of the household.<a href="#notes02c"><sup>26</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Even the tyrant suffered in the general distress. At

        </span>and
        the city fell into the power of Demetrius. The trembling citizens
        expected vengeance for their falling-off from his side some years ago;
        but Demetrius, who had always a softness for Athens, was content to
        ignore their insincerity, and to secure himself against any repetition
        of it by fortifying and garrisoning the Museum rock in the city, as well
        as the maritime forts of Piræus and Munychia ( 295 B.C.)</p>
        <p align="justify">For the next seven years, during which, by one of those strange
        vicissitudes so common in that period, Demetrius held the throne of
        Macedonia, Athens remained tranquil under the Macedonian garrisons at
        her gates. But in 288 B.C., when Demetrius was forced to abandon his
        Macedonian kingdom, the old Athenian love of independence revived, and
        young and old alike, under the leadership of Olympiodôrus, rose in
        rebellion and defeated the Macedonian garrison when it attacked them,
        and captured the fort on Museum hill, though the garrisons in the forts
        still remained. Athens, thus liberated by the help of Pyrrhus of
        Epirus, showed its changed circumstances by setting up honorary decrees
        as a tribute to the great orators who had urged the state a generation
        before to resist the power of Macedon. But the spirit of ancient
        independence was gone. It was to foreign kings that Athens was indebted
        both for its nominal independence and for its very subsistence. The
        princes of the Crimea made it frequent gifts of wheat. Foreign patronage
        is the evidence given by the honorary decrees to the kings of the
        Bosphorus and of Pæonia, to Lysimachus of Thrace, Pyrrhus of Epirus,
        and Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the last years of Epicurus, Athens lived at peace, with Macedonian
        garrisons at her gates; in the Piræus, in Munychia, and in Salamis. In
        Macedonia, Antigonus Gonatas, the son of Demetrius, had succeeded to his
        father's kingdom in 279, and kept up with Zeno and some others of the
        philosophers a friendly intercourse. With Epicurus, who lived out of the
        sphere of politics, and with Arcesilaus, who banished politics from the
        Academy, he had no dealings. Greece, under Macedonia, like Judea under
        the Romans, was not exactly the place where the king and the philosopher
        could meet on fair terms.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus had been from infancy of rather feeble health. In his
        boyhood, it is said, he was so weak that he had to be lifted down from his chair, and so blear-eyed that
        he could not bear to look upon the sun or fire. His skin, too, was so
        tender that any dress beyond a mere tunic was unbearable. Such is the
        account quoted by a lexicographer of the Byzantine period:<a href="#notes02c"><sup>27</sup></a>
        and the maladies of Epicurus are treated as an
        anticipatory judgment of heaven upon him for his alleged impieties.
        Curiously enough, the biographer of Jeremy Bentham tells us how Bentham
        was so weak at seven years of age that he could not support himself on
        tiptoe, and he spoke of himself as the feeblest of feeble boys:<a HREF="/l%202"><sup>28</sup></a>
        but the greatest bigot would hardly go so far out of his
        way as to suggest that Bentham's views richly deserved such an
        organization as his portion. It was also suggested that Epicurus's
        ill-health was due to his loose and luxurious life. One of his pupils
        apparently wrote in refutation of these charges.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the year 270 B.C. Epicurus died at Athens. For a fortnight before
        his end he had suffered much from obstruction by stone in the bladder.<a href="#notes02c"><sup>29</sup></a>&nbsp;
        But up to the last moment his intellect was unimpaired:
        he dwelt both in conversation and his letters, on the memories of
        philosophic fellowship</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">When each by turns was guide to each,<br>
          And fancy light from fancy caught,<br>
          And thought leapt out to wed with thought<br>

          had taught. His last personal care was for the children of a disciple
          who had died before him, and for whom he asked his benevolent friends
          to continue the attentions and support which they had hitherto given
          to himself.</p>

        the stranger,&quot; says Seneca, &quot;comes to the gardens on which the
        words are inscribed:<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"> </span>'Friend, here it will be well for thee to
        abide: here pleasure is the highest good,' he will find the keeper of
        that garden a kindly, hospitable man, who will set before him a dish of
        barley porridge and water in plenty, and say, 'Hast thou not been well
        entertained? These gardens do not whet hunger, but quench it: they do
        not cause a greater thirst by the very drinks they afford, but soothe it
        by a remedy which is natural and costs nothing. In pleasure like this I
        have grown old.'&quot;<sup><a href="#notes03a">1</a></sup>&nbsp;
        &quot;Epicurus, the Gargettian,&quot; says another writer,<sup><a href="#notes03a">2</a></sup>
        &quot;cried aloud, and said: 'To whom a little is not enough, nothing is
        enough. Give me a barley-cake and water, and I am ready to vie even with
        Zeus in happiness.'&quot; In words like these we have a picture of the
        garden of Epicurus. At first sight it presents the idea of a society of
        ascetics rather than of voluptuaries, and of dietetic reformers rather
        than philosophers. &quot;We ought,&quot; says Epicurus, &quot;to be on
        our guard against any dishes which, though we are eagerly desirous of
        them beforehand, yet leave no sense of gratitude behind after we have
        enjoyed them.&quot;<a HREF="#notes03a"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; Instead of
        the revelry and dainty dishes which we should probably associate with
        the name of <i>epicure,</i> we find a meal of plain bread and water,
        with half a pint of light wine occasionally added. &quot;Send me,&quot;
        says Epicurus, in one of his letters, &quot;some cheese of Cythnos, so
        that when I will, I may fare sumptuously.&quot;<a HREF="#notes03a"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;
        The life of the Epicurean circle attempted to inculcate plain living,
        not as a duty, but as a pleasure. Probably, if we believe the stories of
        the ill-health of Epicurus and his friends, there may have been
        something of a dietetic experiment in this behaviour. The society was
        not, indeed, in principle vegetarian; on the contrary, they justified
        the use of animal flesh for food, much on the same metaphysical ground
        as Spinoza afterwards employed; <i>i.e.</i>, the immense generic
        difference which they believed to separate man from the brute. But in
        practice, their diet, like that of so many other philosophers, was
        mainly vegetarian. Their temperate habits seem to have drawn down upon
        them the jokes of the comic poets. &quot;Your water drinking,&quot; says
        a character in one of their plays,<a HREF="#notes03a"><sup>5</sup></a>
        makes you useless to the state: whilst by my potations I increase the
        revenue.&quot; Philemon puts the following words into the mouth of one
        of his characters:<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">
        </span>&quot;This fellow is bringing in a new philosophy: he preaches
        hunger, and disciples follow him. They get but a single roll, a dried
        fig to relish it, and water to wash it down.&quot;<a HREF="#notes03a"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;
        So, too, when Juvenal draws his sketch of the real wants of human
        nature, he identifies what is required to free us from cold and thirst
        and hunger, with the conveniences which Epicurus in his little garden
        found sufficient.<a HREF="#notes03a"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">To place this aspect of Epicureanism in the
        foreground seems justified by the whole tenor of the system. To them the
        life of man was a life at once of the body and the soul. Epicurus
        declared himself unable to understand what was meant by a pleasure where
        the body and its various senses were utterly and entirely ignored. The
        common doctrine of so many ancient philosophers, that the senses and the
        instincts must be checked, repressed or ignored <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>that apathy, or the absence of sense
        and feeling, is the ideal perfection of the sage <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>was a doctrine against which he always
        contended. It was easy for opponents to say that such a protest opened
        the door to sensuality, and to hint that she was even asked to come in.
        But it is easy to see that the point with Epicurus was that philosophy
        must keep constantly in view the fact, that humanity is embodied in
        flesh and blood, and that the body, if ignored in theory, will somehow
        manage to avenge itself in practice. He had come to know the
        experimental truth of the proposition, that what we are depends so much
        on what we eat. And the words of Metrodôrus, his disciple, which gave
        so much offence to delicate ears, when he says, that &quot;the doctrine
        which follows nature has for its main object the stomach,&quot;<a HREF="#notes03a"><sup>8</sup></a>
        were probably not so heinous in their meaning as some critics supposed.
        A good digestion is the basis of a happy life: and dyspepsia is the root
        of all evils. This aphorism, paradoxical and one-sided as it may be, is
        not necessarily vicious. Plato had already partly recognised the truth
        of the observation; and one may pardon the emphasis laid on the
        doctrine, if we assume the speaker to have been somewhat of a
        valetudinarian. It is one of the tendencies of our day to lay stress,
        probably an exaggerated stress, on the personal care of health, and to
        attach enormous importance to a reasonable diet. The moral doctrines of
        Plato and Aristotle had been a trifle too exacting for humanity: they
        elevated virtue, as Descartes says, to a great height, but they scarcely
        showed how the height could be scaled.<a HREF="#notes03a"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Epicurus comes and begins at the beginning: a simple and natural life
        with simple enjoyments is his ideal. If we remember, too, that according
        to the Epicurean theory pleasure is defined as the complete removal of
        the painful state, and that, once achieved, the pleasure can never be
        intensified, but only varied by any subsequent additions, we can
        understand how Epicurus bids his friends to rest content with simple
        fare. Costly fare only gives a character of variety and multiplicity to
        the enjoyment which it cannot increase.</p>
        <p align="justify">Who were the members of this society? the guests who
        sought the hospitality of the sage? the friends who permanently remained
        with him? The brotherhood was not a fixed and stationary band. Freely,
        they went and came to hear and see their teacher. Foremost of them all
        in the affections of the master was Metrodôrus. It was at Lampsacus
        that Metrodôrus, who must have then been about twenty years only, first
        came into contact with Epicurus. It seems to have been a case of love at
        first sight, as it were, and the union between them became so close that
        the two clung to each other like an elder and a younger brother, and
        Metrodôrus never was absent from the circle save for six months, while
        he paid a visit to his native town. Epicurus was never tired of praising
        his friend for his goodness and unwearied spirit. He married Leontion,
        another disciple of the garden, and died at the age of fifty-three,
        seven years before Epicurus, leaving behind him a son and a daughter to
        the care of the survivor. His brother Timocrates was for awhile another
        of the band, but he ultimately became a renegade and an opponent. His
        sister Batis was married to Idomeneus, another disciple, also belonging
        to Lampsacus, and of some note as an historian; another brother is also
        mentioned. A fourth disciple from the same place was Polyænus, who is
        said to have been before his conversion a notable mathematician. From
        Mitylene came the successor of Epicurus in the headship, Hermarchus. He
        was the son of poor parents, and had begun life by the study of
        rhetoric, but afterwards distinguished himself as a philosopher. To
        Lampsacus, too, belonged Leonteus and his wife Themista. Their son was
        named after their teacher. From Lampsacus also came Colôtes, of whom it
        is told that when first he heard Epicurus expounding the natural system,
        he fell at his feet and did him reverence; whereupon Epicurus, not to be
        outdone, worshipped and complimented him in return. It would have made,
        says Plutarch in a scoffing mood, an excellent subject for a picture.<a HREF="#notes03a"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">There were other members of the society, such as
        Pythocles, a young man, on whom Epicurus had built high hopes of future
        excellence. Leontion has been already mentioned. With her and Themista
        Epicurus kept up a correspondence, as he did with his other friends.
        Leontion belonged to the class of women whom the Greeks termed female
        comrades <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>the same class to which Aspasia, the
        morganatic wife of Pericles, had belonged. Of her history and character
        we know almost nothing. That she possessed some literary and philosophic
        abilities may be inferred from the statement that she wrote an essay in
        criticism of a work by the philosopher Theophrastus.<a HREF="#notes03b"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;
        According to the marriage-laws of the old Greek communities, it was
        impossible for her to form a legitimate union with a citizen. She was
        excluded from the fashionable and respectable womanhood, and in the
        demimonde to which she belonged could only win at the best a dubious
        rank by her wit, her learning, or her beauty. In the constant wars and
        revolutions which destroyed the male population of many Greek towns of
        those times, and threw numbers of women destitute upon the world as
        slaves or as homeless aliens, women of this class must have been
        numerous. They possessed or acquired qualifications in their
        intelligence, accomplishments, and knowledge of the world, which made
        them abler to attract and enchain men than their more respectable and
        extremely ignorant sisters, who had never left the seclusion of their
        homes to mingle with the world, and for whom wedlock meant simply an
        arrangement for housekeeping. To have married an undowered wife would,
        to an Athenian, have seemed a monstrous impossibility. The readers of
        Terence (whose originals depict the contemporaries of Epicurus) are
        aware that a young lady who had been left penniless had no course open
        except to become an artist, a singer, a player on the flute, or dancer,
        if she wished to rise above indigence; and thus circumstances forced her
        into the demimonde of the large towns. But to judge of these <i>hetæræ,</i>
        or emancipated women, we must look at them in the light of their
        historical surroundings, and not by abstract principles or by
        considerations derived from modern European morality.</p>
        <p align="justify">Leontion had become, as far as she apparently could,
        the wife, <i>i.e.</i>, technically or legally, the concubine of
        Metrodôrus, whose mother and sister sent congratulations on the
        occasion of the marriage.<a HREF="#notes03b"><sup>12</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>But Leontion was not, according to various chroniclers, the only
        lady to be found among the disciples of Epicurus. Marmarion (or, as she
        seems more probably named in the manuscripts of Herculaneum, Mammarion
        or Mammaron),<sup><a HREF="#notes03b">13</a></sup> Hedia (Sweet),
        Erotion (Loveling), and Nikidion (Victorine), are the names given by one
        writer; another adds Boidion; and a third erroneously inserts Philaenis,
        among the &quot;young and handsome women,&quot; who, as it is phrased,
        &quot;haunted the garden.&quot; Scandal fastened with avidity on these
        circumstances. Partly, it seems, through the agency of a Stoic, called
        Diotimus, who bore the Epicureans a bitter grudge, there appeared a
        collection of fifty letters, purporting to be the correspondence between
        Epicurus and his mistresses. Leontion was the chief victim of these
        libels, which human nature unfortunately is inclined to believe must
        have something in them, once they have been published. What Leontion was
        like we know not. But we do know that there were two portraits of her
        known to the historian of ancient art, the elder Pliny. The first is not
        specially described. But the other depicted Leontion in the attitude of
        thought.<a HREF="/l%203"><sup>14</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp; </font>With
        Mammaron and the rest scandal was equally busy, telling how each of them
        was the favourite of one or another of the chief disciples of Epicurus.
        To these scandals the school opposed in antiquity a unanimous denial,
        and we have no grounds for refusing to accept their disclaimer. It is
        one of the regular consequences attending a departure from the standard
        of social morality, that failure in one department is presumed to carry
        with it failure in any of the rules of ethics. Nothing is too bad to be
        believed of such a one. And so later gossip-mongers fastened with
        avidity on the theme. They drew fancy pictures of the loose society and
        depraved manners of the garden, and depicted Leontion as an unblushing
        daughter of sin, and Epicurus as her special paramour. In one of the
        writers, who wrote letters purporting to be the composition of
        well-known persons of the past, and sketched novelettes in
        correspondence, we find Epicurus represented as a hoary valetudinarian
        sinner, urging his unwelcome love on the young Leontion, who has given
        her heart and person to another lover.<a HREF="/l%201"><sup>15</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>Some enemies of the system were even inclined to attribute the
        ill-health of its early chiefs to their licentious lives.</p>
        <p align="justify">These slanders not unnaturally grew up in the minds
        of those who combined the fact that women were not excluded from the
        garden, with the open doctrine of the school, that pleasure was the aim
        of life, and especially with sayings of Epicurus, in which he claimed
        for our animal nature its right to free development. But there can
        hardly be a doubt that they are gross exaggerations, springing from that
        common failing which accuses an intellectual opponent of all manner of
        vices and immoralities. These meetings, where, as an old French writer
        says,<sup><a HREF="/l%201">16</a> </sup>&quot;the fair sex, despising
        all that slander and jealousy could say against them, wished to have a
        share, and grudged men the good fortune of being the sole disciples and
        hearers of this philosopher,&quot; were probably as harmless as other
        gatherings of unlicensed religious sects, where the suspicion of foes
        has been ready to suppose all unholy excesses of sensuality. Had the
        life of Plotinus been written by an enemy instead of a friend, we should
        have probably heard a very different story about the lady in whose house
        he lived, her daughter, and the other women who followed his steps. Yet,
        at the same time, it would be a mistake to suppose that the ideas which
        chivalry has made familiar to the modern world were present in the
        Epicurean fold. Such sentiments, elevating womanhood into a religious
        power, and a symbol of the best and sweetest humanity, were unknown to
        the ancient world. The Greek world, in particular, never rose much above
        the naturalistic and practical aspects of conjugal life. Æsthetic
        emotions and ethical influences were not conceived as any part of the
        love of woman. All that we can safely affirm of the Epicurean society
        is, that licentiousness is unproven. That the purity of womanhood, the
        dignity of ladyhood, existed in the society otherwise than in the
        surrounding world is what we must not affirm.</p>
        <p align="justify">There is another side to the picture, probably
        equally exaggerated with the last. As that alleged debauchery, so this
        presents us with a picture of a hospital or infirmary. The chief
        philosophers in the school are in this account all the victims of some
        malady, due probably to their own misconduct, and they all die
        wretchedly, as atheists and infidels ought. An older writer speaks in
        somewhat milder terms. He tells us what a source of joy and consolation
        it was to Epicurus to think of three of his friends and disciples, whom
        he had tended through their sickness, and now fondly recollected when
        they had departed.<sup><a HREF="#notes03b">17</a></sup><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>His best-loved disciples, Metrodôrus, Polyænus, and Pythocles,
        died before him. Epicurus having tenderly cared for them, wasted no time
        in unavailing regrets. A true friendship and a pure love are an
        imperishable inheritance for the soul who has enjoyed it, and the memory
        of such concordant lives may be a source of strength and great joy to
        the survivor. It was one of the sayings of Epicurus, that we are
        ungrateful to the past in not recalling the blessings we have erewhile
        experienced, and counting them among our permanent joys. The three
        brothers of Epicurus, Neocles, Chæredemus, and Aristobulus, also died
        before him. Perhaps no circumstance connected with his disciples is more
        noteworthy than the way in which they clung to him and his doctrine.
        &quot;Great was the reverence of his brothers towards Epicurus,&quot;
        says Plutarch; &quot;their affection and brotherly feeling made them
        enthusiastic disciples; and even if they were mistaken in the belief,
        which they had from their very boyhood formed, that there was no one so
        wise as Epicurus, still, the man who could inspire such a feeling, and
        those who could feel it, deserve our admiration.&quot;<a HREF="#notes03b"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">But the real picture was a pleasing one. Friendship
        was the prevailing spirit of the garden, and knit together its members
        in every part of the world. A common life supplemented the common
        doctrine. The pupils, if pupils they may be called, were more the
        associates and companions of the master than auditors of his lectures.
        It was their fellowship with their leader which made them great men, and
        not his instruction merely. They took a deep affectionate interest in
        all the concerns of one another; and their letters to each other in
        their temporary absences exhibit the tender domestic tie which bound
        together the members of the inner circle. One instance may be given. We
        knew that Epicurus during the second half of his life twice or thrice
        tempted the dangers of the sea (he was nearly drowned, it seems, on one
        voyage) to visit his friends in Asia Minor.<font color="#0000FF"><sup><a HREF="#notes03b">19</a>&nbsp;</sup></font><font color="#0000ff">
        </font>Among the charred manuscripts recovered from Herculaneum there is
        found a mutilated letter apparently written by Epicurus, and apparently
        addressed to the daughter of Metrodôrus, the young girl for whose
        welfare he felt anxious on his deathbed. &quot;We have arrived,&quot;
        says the writer, &quot;safe and sound at Lampsacus, <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        On certain days the community seems to have observed a fast. In a letter
        to Polyænus, for instance, Epicurus indulges in playful boast that
        while Metrodôrus has only reduced his expenses to sixpence, he himself
        has been able to live comfortably on a less sum.<a HREF="#notes03c"><sup>21</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>The purpose of such abstinence was not ascetic; but to determine
        on how little it was possible to be happy. A life led on these maxims
        can scarcely have produced those &quot;fat sleek swine of Epicurus's
        herd&quot;<a HREF="#notes03c"><sup>22</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>to which Horace alludes; and one is more inclined to say with
        Seneca that the pleasure of Epicurus is very &quot;sober and dry,&quot;<a HREF="#notes03c"><sup>23</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">
        </font>and &quot;reduced to small and slender dimensions.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In this brotherhood, where reasoning on the aims of
        life took the place of a lecture, and simple meals with kindly converse
        restrained the furies of controversy, each was his brother's keeper.
        Even in those early days all were not of one opinion. Leontion and
        Colôtes are alleged to have had their little errors. When the chiefs of
        the sect saw such divergence, it was not, however, their way to correct
        the offender directly. Rather they wrote to another member, exposing and
        correcting these errors as supposed mistakes of their correspondent. In
        such a way Leontion saw her mistakes pointed out in a letter of the
        master to Colôtes.<a HREF="#notes03c"><sup>23</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>But, on the whole, though there was a certain liberty left on
        secondary points, the main doctrines of the society were stereotyped.
        The disciples were recommended to get by rote the fundamental articles
        or catechism, in which the doctrine was summarized. &quot;Which of
        you,&quot; says Cicero to the Epicureans, &quot;has not learned by rote
        this catechism?&quot;<a HREF="#notes03c"><sup>24</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>And in some points, therefore, blind following of the master's
        authority was preached in the school: his writings, and those of the two
        other members of the Epicurean triumvirate, were treated as
        authoritative, as inspired, as a sort of Bible. Thus, in the close of
        one of the fragments on Rhetoric written by Philodemus, we find that
        author saying: &quot;If Epicurus and Metrodôrus and Hermarchus declare
        that there is such an art (as sophistical rhetoric), as we shall point
        out in the sequel, then those of our sect who write against their view
        are not very far from deserving the punishment of a parricide.&quot;<a HREF="#notes03c"><sup>25</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>But it was no deterrent from composition that the writer was
        bound by his creed. &quot;The Epicureans,&quot; says Cicero, &quot;do
        not refrain from writing on the same topics as Epicurus and their old
        chiefs.&quot; On the contrary. When Philodemus is drawing to the close
        of another treatise, the thought occurs to him, that he may be blamed
        for undertaking a work on economics. &quot;It is enough for me that
        Metrodôrus, as well as Epicurus, enjoins and advises and administers
        more diligently and down to minor points, and even practises what he
        teaches.&quot;<font color="#0000FF"><sup><a HREF="#notes03c">26</a>&nbsp;</sup></font><font color="#0000ff">
        </font>But there are many points, it should be added, in which the same
        writer indicates his divergence from the leaders and teachers of his
        sect.</p>
        <p align="justify">It may be asked how was this society maintained? It
        was not a class of pupils like those which gathered round other
        philosophers. As Seneca says, it was not the school, but the life in
        common with Epicurus, which made Metrodôrus and his companions men of
        note.<font color="#0000FF"><sup><a HREF="#notes03c">27</a>&nbsp;</sup></font><font color="#0000ff">
        </font>Some of his followers had suggested that they should throw all
        their property into a common fund; but Epicurus rejected the suggestion
        of communism as savouring of distrust and as laying a restraint on
        freewill offerings. But though the friends did not surrender their goods
        into a club-property, a number of them paid a voluntary contribution or
        rate to the head of the school: and we have a letter in which he
        requests that one of these contributors will continue this payment after
        his death for the benefit of the two orphan children of Metrodôrus, in
        whom he took an interest.<a HREF="#notes03c"><sup>28</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>In another letter to his friend Idomeneus, he says: &quot;Send us
        first-fruits, therefore, unto the tending of the sacred body, both for
        myself and the children.&quot;<font color="#0000FF"><sup><a href="#notes03c">29</a></sup></font><font color="#0000ff">
        </font>And, again, he tells some other friends: &quot;Bravely and
        splendidly you showed care of us in the matter of procuring the corn,
        and manifested prodigious tokens of your goodwill towards me.&quot; But
        the gifts thus rendered were paralleled by other gifts from Epicurus <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        </font>as it is sarcastically put, among his needy friends.</p>
        <p align="justify">The scene, in fact, presented by the history of the
        Epicurean garden reminds us of the generosity and brotherly charity
        exhibited by the various congregations of the infant Christian Church:
        and the letters of Epicurus and his chief followers are not without
        their analogues in the Epistles of St. Paul. In both there is the same
        mixture of discourse on high topics, with allusions to humble matters of
        daily life. We feel in both cases that the members of the sect take a
        family human interest in the minutest concerns of each other. Such
        trifles seemed to the dignified and aristocratic ancient critics to be
        unworthy of a philosopher. But in truth Epicurus came partly to teach
        the importance of such little things in the economy of mankind. And his
        language, which, presented apart from the context, appears often
        exaggerated and stilted, would probably offer another aspect if we saw
        the whole. It is one of the great losses, so far as our knowledge of
        ancient social life is concerned, that the letters of Epicurus to and
        from friends, which were preserved by his school as carefully as the
        letters of the Apostles by the Christian Church, have disappeared,
        leaving hardly a trace behind. They were evidently in existence in the
        second century of our era, and formed an important element in the
        literature of Epicureanism.</p>
        <p align="justify">According to Diogenes, the number of the friends of
        Epicurus was so great that they could not have been counted by whole
        cities. We have already spoken of Metrodôrus and his brother Timocrates.
        The latter did not continue faithful to the cause: he quarrelled with
        his brother, and the dispute was carried into acrimonious pamphlets.
        Epicurus tried to affect a reconciliation; but his rebukes had not the
        desired effect, and the renegade became one of the chief accusers of the
        life and morality of his former associates.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>31</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>Such charges from friends who have become enemies are never very
        credible, but in this case they are specially discredited by the common
        tendency of the ancient world to adopt the language of Billingsgate
        against an opponent. Mithras the Syrian, steward of Lysimachus, king of
        Thrace, was another Epicurean who seems to have been a regular
        contributor. One of the essays of Epicurus was dedicated to him. On some
        occasion he was in difficulties at the Piræus, and Epicurus loudly
        praises Metrodôrus for the goodly and gallant way in which he had gone
        down to the sea to help him.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>32</sup></a>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">
        </font>These and other slight deeds are contemptuously contrasted by
        Plutarch with the deeds of great generals and statesmen. But it is not
        perhaps going too far to say that these and other interchanges of
        benevolence between the members of a sect which did not count many rich
        or noble, are found entitled to the blessing awarded to the cup of cold
        water given to a disciple in the name of a disciple.</p>
        <p align="justify">The affairs of the brotherhood were considerably
        affected by a will which Epicurus left behind him.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>33</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>It divided his small fortune in two directions; for the general
        interest of his society and doctrine, and the special behoof of the
        orphans of two of his friends. According to the terms of the bequest,
        deposited in the office of the State archives, the temple of the mother
        of the gods ( Metrôon), his whole property was handed over to two
        trustees for the following purposes. The garden and its appurtenances,
        and the school or lecture-room erected in it, were to be held for behoof
        of Hermarchus, the immediate successor of Epicurus, and for all who
        might in time follow him in that post. The house in Melité was to be
        used by Hermarchus and his fellow philosophers as a dwelling during the
        life of the former. A sum of money was further placed to the credit of
        the trustees, who in conjunction with Hermarchus were to divide it in
        certain portions. One portion was to go to keep up the Fête celebrated
        in memory of the departed parents and brothers of Epicurus. Another part
        went to defray the expenses of the social meetings held annually on the
        anniversary of the birthday of Epicurus (the 10th of the Attic month
        Gamêlion), and on the 20th day of every month, in memory of the
        conjoint names of Epicurus and Metrodôrus. His brothers and his friend
        Polyænus had also yearly days of remembrance appointed. These
        provisions for the saints' days of the Epicurean calendar were the
        general and permanent provisions of the will.</p>
        <p align="justify">Its special articles enjoined the trustees to be the
        guardians of a younger Epicurus, son of Metrodærus, and of the son of
        Polyænus; as also of the daughter of Metrodôrus. The three children
        were to be supported, and the girl when she reached marriageable years
        was to receive a dowry from the fund, and to be married to one of the
        members of the school selected by Hermarchus. One of the older members
        of the brotherhood who had left all to follow wisdom with Epicurus, was
        especially commended to the notice of the trustees. The books of the
        founder were to pass over to Hermarchus. Finally, three of his bondmen
        and one bondwoman were granted their freedom.</p>
        <p align="justify">This testament, which may be compared with others
        left about the same time by the chiefs of the Peripatetic school, is in
        many ways noteworthy. Its care for the young orphans is, in its
        affectionate decorum, the best refutation of the calumnies raised
        against Epicurus. His emancipation of the slaves may be paralleled by
        similar acts in the testaments of Theophrastus, Strato, and Lyco, the
        three successive heads of the Aristotelian school One of these slaves,
        named Mys (Mouse), had been a fellow-worker in philosophy with his
        master. The distinction in the will between the house in Melité and the
        garden suggests some difficulties for those who, like Pliny, suppose
        that the garden lay inside the city. Indeed, from a remark in Cicero, it
        would seem indubitable that the garden lay on the N.W. of Athens, a
        little off the road which led to the &quot;Academy&quot; of Plato.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>34</sup></a>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff">
        </font>In other words, it lay outside the walled city, and like the
        local seats of two at least of the other schools was an open garden in
        the suburbs. While Epicurus thus endowed the Epicurean sect, the other
        sects had done likewise. The will of Theophrastus hands over &quot;the
        garden and the walk, and the houses by the garden&quot; to certain of
        his friends for purposes of the common pursuit of philosophy.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>35</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>The garden of Plato similarly served as a meeting-place for his
        school, who in the next generation after his death began to erect small
        huts near the abode of their muses.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>36</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>And in both schools common festivals, in the shape of monthly
        dinners, kept the students together socially. There is thus a pleasing
        family and home character about these sects, which contrasts with the
        sterner practice of the Stoics.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus we see that philosophy was endowed long before
        the emperor attached it to the patronage of the State. Indeed, it may be
        suggested that public governmental support was the last thing Epicurus
        could expect. When the lectures are mentioned which the Ephêbi, or
        young Athenian collegians, attended, one finds no notice of the schools
        of the Epicureans among the rest.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>37</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>All along they seem to have had little connection with the
        educational machinery recognised by the State, and to have formed a sect
        apart from their scientific and literary rivals, and one can hardly
        argue from the latter to the former. Young students destined to be
        future citizens could learn little suitable for public life, for the
        bar, or for the senate, in the gardens of Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">The directions of Epicurus seem to have been in all
        points faithfully carried out by his executors and successors. An

        Garden,&quot; were his five immediate followers in the headship of the
        school. How succession to the headship was determined we cannot say with
        absolute certainty, but it is highly probable that the departing chief
        named as his successor the man whom public opinion in the society marked
        out for the post. We hear of no squabbles about the succession, no
        attempts of ambitious youths to anticipate their time, and claim a post
        reserved for mature experience. The birthday of Epicurus continued to be
        kept regularly as an annual festival by his followers; and the monthly
        meetings on the 20th (<i>Eikas</i>) became so prominent a feature of the
        sect in the eyes of the world, that the Epicureans came to be nicknamed <i>Eikadistæ</i>
        (or Men of the Twentieth.)<sup><a href="#notes03d">38</a></sup><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>Pictures of Epicurus were found in the rooms and bedchambers of
        Epicureans, and even on their rings and their plates.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">The school clung faithfully to the doctrines of their
        master. He himself had composed short synopses to keep the main outlines
        of the system constant in the memory. In the latter part of the second
        century A.D., a Pythagorean philosopher contrasts, with the divergence
        of the later Academy from the teaching of Plato and with the variety of
        opinion amongst the Stoics, the unfaltering adherence of the Epicureans
        to the dogmas of their master. &quot;Innovation,&quot; he says, &quot;is
        condemned by them as a crime, or rather an impiety. The school of
        Epicurus resembles a true commonwealth; free from civil war, exhibiting
        a single mind, a single opinion.&quot;<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>40</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>In similar terms Seneca, in the first century A.D., adverts to
        the deference of the sect to the dicta of the master; and a century
        before his time Cicero has the same story to tell.</p>
        <p align="justify">The language in which the Epicureans speak of their
        master is quite unlike that of any other philosophical school for its
        founder. When the Stoic is asked to point out an historical type of his
        ideal wise man, he confesses the shortcomings even of Zeno, and is
        unwilling to affirm that either Socrates or Diogenes the Cynic will
        stand the test and present an incarnate paragon of goodness and wisdom.</p>
        <p align="justify">But even in the lifetime of Epicurus we have seen the
        almost divine worship of which he was the object. Colôtes falls down at
        his feet and does him reverence <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">—</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">
        </span>though, it is true, Epicurus gently
        returns the compliment and chides his extravagant admirer. Metrodôrus
        speaks of the truly god-revealing sacramental services (<i>orgia</i>) of
        Epicurus.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>41</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>To the Roman Epicurean poet, his master seems a grander and more
        beneficent being than any of the gods whom his countrymen held in
        reverence: his words are golden words, ever most worthy of an endless
        life.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>42</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp; </font>And
        the language of the speakers on the Epicurean side in Cicero's works is
        of the same tenor: Epicurus is the one man who has seen the truth, freed
        men's minds from the greatest delusions, and taught all that is needful
        for a good and happy life: he is the discoverer of truth and the
        architect of blessedness: his rule of conduct has, as it were, descended
        from heaven to give knowledge to all mankind.<a HREF="#notes03d"><sup>43</sup></a><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;
        </font>The devotion of the school and its quasi-religious observances,
        in fact, formed a favourite subject of jesting for the world.</p>

        student of Epicureanism is placed at a great disadvantage, as compared
        with the student of the other schools of ancient philosophy. The
        historians of Platonism and Aristotelianism have a large collection of
        the writings both of Plato and Aristotle, on which to base their
        expositions. In their case the want of authentic documents only makes
        itself felt when an attempt is made to trace the historical career of
        the two systems. There is also no doubt a textual difficulty to be met.
        Questions must be answered about the several portions of their reputed
        works <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>as to the genuineness of particular dialogues of Plato, or
        treatises of Aristotle, and as to the relations of one part of the
        system to another. In the case of Stoicism and Epicureanism there is
        quite another condition of affairs. The writings of the founders of
        these schools and of their early disciples have almost entirely
        disappeared, and we are dependent on the statements of authors who lived
        more than two centuries after the organization of the system. But even
        here Stoicism is better off than Epicureanism. The works of Seneca,
        Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius exhibit in large outlines, and amid
        varied surroundings, the main dogmas of the ethical creed of the Porch,
        as it was understood and practised in the first and second centuries,
        A.D. We catch the general spirit of Stoicism in this way much more
        tangibly than can be done by observing a number of isolated aphorisms.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet, one writer Epicureanism does possess, in whom
        the spirit of the system has found ample expression, coloured, perhaps,
        by the Roman utilitarian and didactic spirit, and by the Roman sense of
        dignity, and stamped with the earnestness of the man. Lucretius, in his
        poem on the nature of things, <i>&quot;De Naturâ Rerum,&quot;</i> has
        given a Latin representation of the Epicurean creed which must be
        pronounced to be, on the whole, accurate and faithful. But the poem,
        posthumously edited, did not receive the last touches of its author's
        hand. It is full of casual or unskillful junctures, and wanting in
        continuity; it emphasizes certain sides of the system to the neglect of
        others, and it is too much encumbered by the exigencies of verse to be
        able to follow freely the subtleties of argument. Yet, as the only
        exposition of Epicureanism by a zealous convert to its creed, it claims
        a unique value amongst the authorities on this subject.</p>
        <p align="justify">In some respects, however, the standard and primary
        authority for the system, as well as for the history, which others may
        supplement and correct, but cannot entirely supersede, is the tenth book
        of the history of the lives and opinions of the ancient philosophers, by
        Diogenes Laertius. This book, of which Thomas Stanley's &quot;History of
        Philosophy,&quot;<a href="#notes04"><sup>1</sup></a><sup> </sup>may
        practically, for English readers, be regarded as a paraphrase, is an
        extremely unsatisfactory and tantalizing performance. It is a
        compilation made in the third century A.D. from the contents of a large
        number of works on the history of the several sects of ancient
        philosophy <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>works which have not come down to us. It mixes up the most
        irrelevant matters; indulges largely in gossip, scandal, <i>bon mot</i>, and
        anecdote; and is almost blameless of any attempt at artistic or critical
        arrangement. Contradictory statements from different authorities are
        placed impartially side by side, and you are left to choose from the
        heap your materials for a harmonious and intelligible picture. Of
        course, it is invaluable to have this variety of aspect; but in the want
        of some central point around which the variations may be grouped, and
        with our ignorance of the value of many of these authorities, the task
        of the critical historian is onerous, and at many points hopelessly
        insuperable. In the tenth book, which is entirely devoted to Epicurus,
        these faults are not so prominent as in other parts of the work.
        Diogenes (of Laertes, a small place on the coast of the rocky Cilicia)<a HREF="#notes04"><sup>2</sup></a>
        has been supposed to be either an adherent or admirer of Epicureanism.
        This is, to say the least, doubtful; but in any case he has largely
        availed himself of sources in which Epicurean sympathies predominated.<a HREF="#notes04"><font size="3"><sup>3</sup></font></a>
        After giving at some length the stories told to the discredit of
        Epicurus, he begins a contradiction of them by the emphatic words:
        &quot;But these men are mad: for of the excellent candour of Epicurus
        towards all men there are many witnesses.&quot; Besides a copy of the
        will of Epicurus, his account contains three epistles purporting to have
        been written by the philosopher to three of his disciples. The first of
        these, addressed to one Herodotus, contains an epitome of the main
        principles by which Epicureanism explained the constitution of the
        universe and the process of knowledge; in other words, its natural
        philosophy. The second epistle, that to Pythocles, deals with the
        principles employed in accounting for the phenomena of astronomy and
        meteorology. The third letter to Menœceus summarizes the moral teaching
        of the school, and is supplemented by quotation of the Articles (the <i>&#922;<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">&#972;</span>&#958;&#945;&#953;</i>).<a HREF="#notes04"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;
        How far these letters, which as they stand exhibit a somewhat difficult
        and apparently corrupt text, were really written by Epicurus is a
        question which, considering the temptation to the forgery of letters in
        antiquity, has naturally been raised. Of the genuineness of the second
        letter, that to Pythocles, we know that doubts had been raised in the
        first century B.C.<a HREF="#notes04"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;
        We know also, however, from the agreement between it and the fifth and
        sixth books of Lucretius that it corresponded with the Epicurean
        doctrine in that age. And the same may be said of the two other letters,
        of which the genuineness has been unreasonably doubted by Buhle and
        others. They could subserve no purpose, as far as we can see, except to
        epitomize and make accessible to the faithful the fundamental views of
        Epicurus. If not genuine, they seem at least to be authentic. No
        personal or polemical motive enters into the first and third; and the
        polemic of the second introduces no names.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of other sources for Epicureanism the principal are
        Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch, Stobæus, and Athenæus. Joannes Stobæus, a
        Byzantine writer of the sixth century A.D., as well as the original
        compiler of the treatise conventionally ascribed to Plutarch on the
        opinions of the philosophers, contain a few, not particularly
        intelligent, statements as to the Epicurean views on sundry topics of
        physics, and quote occasionally what professes to be Epicurean
        phraseology. Plutarch, besides incidental references scattered through
        his genuine writings, has devoted two of his essays to a keen criticism
        of the Epicurean views, in the course of which he refers to many points
        in the history of the sect, in a way to show that material on that topic
        was in his time abundant. The two treatises are entitled: &quot;On the
        Impossibility even of a Pleasant Life, for One who adopts the Principles
        of Epicurus&quot;; and &quot;Against Colôtes&quot; (the Epicurean). Of
        course, in accepting his statements, it is necessary as far as possible
        to discount the bias in his point of view, which tended in the direction
        of a religious and mystical Platonism. As for Athenæus, who wrote about
        a century after Plutarch, towards the close of the second century A.D.,
        his <i>&quot;Deipnosophists&quot;</i> is too much of a <i>chronique
        scandaleuse</i> and too prone to after-dinner exuberance to have more
        than a very subordinate value as an historical document.</p>
        <p align="justify">Cicero and Seneca both tell us a good deal about
        Epicureanism, but in a fragmentary way. In his <i>&quot;De
        Finibus,&quot;</i> his <i>&quot;De Naturâ Deorum,&quot;</i> and the <i>&quot;Tusculan
        Questions,&quot;</i> Cicero introduces the Epicurean doctrine, supported
        and expounded by Torquatus and Velleius in the first and second of these
        works respectively. Cicero seems a fair and honest reporter of what he
        does understand, but his method of composition, consisting in a free
        translation and condensation of some of the advocates of the systems he
        expounded, was not favourable either to depth of insight or harmony of
        exposition. There are places in the Tusculan Disputations where he seems
        to forget himself, and holds a brief for Epicureanism without perceiving
        the contradiction with previous statements. His information is mainly
        confined to the ethical portions of Epicureanism, and even there it
        leaves behind an impression of inexactness and want of contact with the
        original ideas, which he looks at too exclusively through a literary
        medium. Nor did Cicero ever possess any genuine interest in philosophy
        except as an interesting topic for discussion; and a philosophy which so
        completely ignored practical and political life could hardly find in him
        a very sympathetic interpreter. Still, as the contemporary of Lucretius,
        his estimates of Epicureanism in Rome are full of interest. Seneca, the
        Stoical tutor of Nero, frequently quotes the sentiments of Epicureanism.
        In his <i>&quot;Moral Letters&quot;</i> where he poses as a spiritual
        director to Lucilius, he closes many of these epistles with a short
        maxim from Epicurus, as a moral lesson for his friend to ponder and
        practise. In others of his writings too he shows greater familiarity
        than Cicero with the physical doctrines of the school of Epicurus. Like
        Plutarch he seems to have been intimately acquainted with the letters of
        Epicurus, and Metrodôrus, and the brethren; which, apparently arranged
        according to chronological order, formed a large part of the Epicurean
        literature.<a HREF="#notes04"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus himself was a voluminous author, vying with
        the Stoic Chrysippus in the number of his works, and surpassing him far,
        when the fact was taken into account that he did not, like the latter,
        fill his books with quotations from other authors. Three hundred volumes
        or rolls is the number at which his literary labours are roughly
        estimated by his biographer.<a HREF="#notes04"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp; Of
        his style we can simply judge by report and a few samples. It is utterly
        without rhetorical grace, exhibits little variety, and is somewhat
        deficient in logical symmetry. He has a very decided manner of his own,
        not moulded upon classical examples, but aiming, not always
        successfully, at the directest and most characteristic expression of his
        thoughts. The sole principle of his utterances was to be perspicuous <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>to
        be understood. He is often, however, involved, and does not shrink from
        repetitions. With iteration of phrase he returns again and again to the
        essential features of his system.<a HREF="/l%201"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;
        The individuality of his style extends even to the formulae of social
        intercourse, which he endeavoured to restore to significance. The
        ancients noticed that instead of the conventional wish for
        &quot;joy&quot; to the recipient of a letter, he substituted one for
        &quot;welfare&quot; or for &quot;good life.&quot; Others objected to the
        occasional exuberance of his style, and to his polysyllabic words for
        simple things.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of these three hundred rolls many no doubt were
        trifling in extent. The list of the more important of them given by
        Diogenes begins with a work on Nature, in thirty-seven books, and ends
        with his Letters; and includes amongst others, essays on the following
        topics: On Atoms and Void; On Love; On the Criterion, or Canon; On the
        Gods; On Piety; On Lives; Symposium; On Sight; On Touch; On Fate; On
        Music; Views about Diseases; On Monarchy, &amp; of all these up to the
        middle of the last century, there was known no more than the pieces
        quoted by Diogenes and by the other writers mentioned above.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the beginning of the eighteenth century various
        excavations were made on the site of the cities which had been
        overwhelmed in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D. About the year 1752
        when the explorations had already been for some time going on at the
        side of the ancient Herculaneum, our knowledge of Epicureanism received
        a considerable addition. A peasant proprietor of Resina on sinking a
        well through the lava which entombed the old city came upon what turned
        out to be the remains of an ancient villa of considerable extent and in
        good preservation.<a HREF="#notes04"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp; Its
        inhabitant had evidently been a man of taste and wealth, for its open
        spaces contained some fine works of ancient art. In one place of the
        villa stood the busts of Epicurus, Hermarchus, Zeno of Sidon, and
        Demosthenes; three heads of the Epicureans, beside the great orator.
        Among the others were two busts which modern research, confronting them
        with the oration of Cicero against Piso, has suggested to be in all
        likelihood the busts of Piso and Gabinius.<a HREF="#notes04"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">But the main discovery was a room containing a large
        number of rolls of papyrus. At first they were treated as worthless.
        Charred and blackened by fire, they seemed like anything but the
        receptacles of literary treasures. At length, when the nature of the
        discovery dawned upon the investigators, it was apparently hopeless to
        do anything with them: they had been so solidified into a single black
        mass by the action of the fire, that it seemed impossible to unroll
        them; nor did the attempts of Sir Humphrey Davy to apply the resources
        of chemistry mend matters. The method, first suggested and employed by a
        monk, from Northern Italy,<a HREF="#notes04b"><sup>11</sup></a> to open
        the papyri by attaching gold-beater's skin to the outside-edge of the
        manuscript, and then slowly unwinding it by means of screws, is the only
        method which has proved at all feasible. By this means about 341 of the,
        1,800 papyri found in the library of the Herculanean villa have up to
        the present date been unwound; and of these 195 have been published.
        When the news first spread through Europe that a whole library of
        ancient manuscripts had been disinterred, the hopes of scholars played
        freely on the possible issues. The lost books of Livy or Tacitus, the
        plays of Menander, and other desiderata of ancient literature, were
        among the treasures expected. But great was the disappointment which
        awaited the philologists. As one by one the dilapidated rolls were
        slowly deciphered, and their inscriptions copied, it was found that
        almost all of them were treatises of Epicurean philosophy. Of the works
        to which the name of the authors can be attached, there have been
        published, up to the present day, sixty-five. Of these, eleven
        manuscripts contain works by Epicurus; but nearly all of them belong to
        his work <i>&quot;On Nature.&quot;</i><a href="#notes04b"><sup>12</sup></a> These have been edited, but
        except in occasionally fortunate passages, where conjecture is easy and
        almost certain, they are a mere wreck of fragments. A few others belong
        to the known names of the Epicurean school, such as Polystratus and
        Colôtes. But the great bulk of these papyri, about forty-five in
        number, consist of essays by Philodemus, the contemporary of Cicero. Of
        these, again, there are thirty rolls which contain what seem to be
        either parts, or modified and corrected versions, of a treatise on
        rhetoric. Besides these there are amongst his essays, papers treating of
        a great number of subjects, showing that at least in his case the
        Epicurean was not idle, and dealt with other topics than the merely
        ethical. We find treatises the virtues and the vices, on the gods, on
        piety, on anger, on death, on wealth, on economics, on poetry, on music,
        on inductive logic; besides a number of compilations dealing with the
        history of the sect, and a variety of notes which Philodemus took from
        the lectures of Zeno, the <i>&quot;Coryphôus of the Epicureans&quot;</i>
        in the first century B.C.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is scarcely possible to resist the evidence thus
        supplied that the room containing these manuscripts was the library or
        study of Philodemus; that, at any rate, it was the receptacle of all his
        papers published or unpublished. There, a century after his time, they
        were overtaken by the eruption of 79 A.D., and buried for nearly
        seventeen centuries. Scarcely less clear is the inference, that the
        villa in question was the property of one who had a special attachment
        to Philodemus <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>an author of whose prose works we do not even hear
        elsewhere. We know that Calpurnius Piso Côsoninus, the father-in-law of
        Cæsar, afforded a domicile to Philodemus, who rendered him literary and
        professional services; and thus it seems as if the villa discovered in
        Herculaneum had been Piso's seaside residence. But whether this be so or
        not, the value of the discovery for the history of ancient philosophy is
        not lessened. In this respect, indeed, it is easy to cherish extravagant
        hopes. The state in which the papyri were found was most disheartening
        and baffling. Scarcely ever is a line absolutely complete. Even when a
        few successive lines are so far perfect that a very little ingenuity can
        supply the defective letters or syllables, a great gap suddenly occurs
        and completely blocks the way to all intelligence of the contents. In
        such circumstances some of the earlier editors gave free play to the
        constructive imagination, and made the mystery into something
        comprehensible, but <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        and will require great diligence combined with scholarly ingenuity,
        before the full fruits, at best somewhat insipid, of these new documents
        can be won. Already Theodor Gomperz, of Vienna, and other German
        scholars,<a HREF="#notes04"><sup>13</sup></a> as well as Domenico

        <p align="justify">The papyri themselves, so far as they have not been
        destroyed, as too often happened in the first attempts at opening them,
        exist in the <i>officina dei Papiri</i> at Naples. Under the auspices of
        the Neapolitan Government several of them were edited, with extensive
        commentary and dissertation, in about ten volumes folio, between the
        years 1795 and 1855. A new series of these <i>&quot;Volumina
        Herculanensia,&quot;</i> as they are entitled, was begun in 1861, and is
        still slowly going on. This collection is a lithographic reproduction
        from the copies taken on unrolling the manuscripts, and is free from
        note or comment. In England, the Bodleian Library rejoices in the
        possession of excellent copies of a large number of the manuscripts, in
        the shape of very accurate pencil tracings on paper, taken on the spot,
        and presented to the University of Oxford by George IV. Out of these a
        selection, dictated at least to some extent by the legibility of the
        manuscripts, and apparently in no connection with the interest of the
        contents, was lithographed, and published in the year 1824.<sup><a HREF="#notes04">14</a></sup></p>

        popular conception of an Epicurean has varied at different times, but at
        no time has it been either very fair or very favourable. To the writers
        of the Roman classical period the charges against Epicureanism were
        drawn from its denial of the divine providence, its open proclamation of
        pleasure as the chief good, its opposition to a merely literary and
        intellectual culture, its withdrawal of its followers from political
        interests and occupations, and the grotesque features in some of its
        physical and physiological speculations. Its unscientific character, and
        its studied indifference, and even hostility, to the prevailing literary
        and logical as well as mathematical investigations of that epoch, were
        probably the chief charges in the count. During the ages of theological
        supremacy which succeeded the downfall of the Empire, Epicurean became
        synonymous with atheist and unbeliever; it meant a follower of the lusts
        of the flesh, with whom there was no fear of God to terrify, no ideal
        aspirations to ennoble, no belief in immortality to check or cheer.
        Irreligion, free-thinking, scepticism, infidelity, on the side of divine
        affairs: and on the human side, a selfish devotion to one's own ease and
        comfort, with no care for country or kindred, were the chief ideas
        connoted by Epicureanism. If we come down to more modern times, the
        Epicurean of Hume's essays is &quot;the man of elegance and
        pleasure.&quot; He refuses to be bound by the arbitrary restraints which
        philosophers impose in seeking to &quot;make us happy by reason and
        rules of art&quot;: he alternates his hours between the &quot;amiable
        pleasure&quot; and &quot;the gay, the frolic virtue&quot;; forgetful of
        the past, secure of the future,&quot; he enjoys the present: the
        sprightly muses are the companions of his cheerful discourses and
        friendly endearments; and, after a day spent in 'all the pleasures of
        sense, and all the joys of harmony and friendship,&quot; the shades of
        night bring him &quot;mutual joy and rapture,&quot; with the charming
        Celia, the mistress of his wishes.<a href="#notes05"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">A cloud hangs, and has hung, over Epicureanism; and
        though we can say with confidence that much of the obloquy is
        undeserved, there will apparently always be a good deal in its teachings
        on which certainty, or even intelligence, is unattainable. The unbiassed
        documentary evidence for exposition which we possess is fragmentary,
        obscure, and does not extend to every part of the philosophic field. On
        the other hand, from a variety of causes, misconstruction and
        misrepresentation have made it their victim. It has been treated as an
        enemy and an interloper by the statesman, the priest, and the
        philosopher.</p>
        <p align="justify">It has shared the common fate of every system which
        attacks either of these great powers, the State, the Church, and the
        republic of arts and letters, and does so without relying on the support
        of one member or other of the triumvirate against the others. Science
        and literature, politics and religion, each and all found themselves
        assailed by the system of Epicurus. That system came forward as a
        philosophical system, and yet it turned a hostile front to the customary
        views of education and of culture, and to the accepted methods and
        results of the sciences.<sup><a HREF="/l%201">2</a></sup>&nbsp; Whilst
        other philosophical doctrines either supported or did not interfere with
        the claims and projects of the political world, Epicureanism openly
        preached a cosmopolitan and humanitarian creed, which taught the citizen
        to stand aloof from patriotic and national obligations, and to live his
        own life as a human being amongst others, in the realm of nature and not
        of statecraft.<sup><a href="#notes05">3</a></sup>&nbsp; As to religion,
        the case was much the same as it was with the State. The gods, like the
        government of the State, disappeared at the fiat of Epicureanism from
        their commanding position above nature, to become part and parcel of the
        great natural process in which they, like all other things, live and
        move and have their being.<a HREF="#notes05"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Above the intellectual structures of science and art, above the gods of
        religious faith, above the laws of political convention, rose man, the
        real individual man, seeking in voluntary association with his
        fellow-men to live his own life to the fullest of his capacity and with
        fullest satisfaction.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of Epicureanism, as of all philosophy, it may be
        said, that it aims at emancipation, liberation, freedom. But scarcely
        anywhere was the emancipation carried to the same length as in
        Epicureanism. Generally speaking, emancipation has meant and means the
        substitution of an ideal for a material or sensuous sovereignty. We are
        freed from the dominion of the passions and the flesh by being handed
        over as subjects to the spirit and the reason. We are taken out of the
        bondage of this world by taking upon ourselves the yoke of the other
        world. The heavenly frees from the earthly, and the intellectual from
        the sensual. Epicureanism professes to impose no yoke or obligation. It
        agrees with other philosophies in distinguishing between the intellect
        and the senses (or what it calls the flesh), and, even in a way, in
        subordinating the latter to the former. But the man of Epicureanism is
        no abstraction <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>a reason struggling in the bonds of an
        alien flesh, which in Pythagorean, and occasionally in Platonic
        language, forms its prison. Man was not held to be a merely
        &quot;rational animal,&quot; as he was defined by the Stoics. The reason
        or understanding in Epicureanism is neither the prisoner <i>de facto</i>,
        nor the lord <i>de jure</i> of the body or flesh. The flesh, in the view
        of Epicurus, is our unenlightened, the understanding our enlightened
        self.</p>
        <p align="justify">The reason is the light which shows us the complete
        nature which we unwittingly are, and in which we blindly and ignorantly
        live; which tells us those laws and limits of our existence of which the
        fleshly nature is unaware, and ignorance whereof breeds vain and
        inevitably baffled hopes. Naturally, or in our flesh, we are like
        children stranded in the darkness of night, with no idea of our true
        position in the world, and inclined to fancy terrors in the gloom which
        surrounds us.<a HREF="#notes05"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp; Hence arises the
        need of philosophy; which, said Epicurus, is an activity that by
        doctrine and reasoning prepares the way for the happy life.<a HREF="#notes05"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">The main problems of philosophy are, therefore, two
        in number; or, Epicureanism falls into two parts. The first is a theory
        of man and of the universe, explaining his position therein, his
        constitution, and natural powers. This is the physiology (<i>&#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;í&#945;</i>),
        or philosophy of nature. The other is the practical application of the
        knowledge so acquired to the regulation of conduct. This is the
        practical or ethical part of the system. It is at the same time evident
        that the two parts cannot be completely separated. The theoretical
        examination has its course limited by the practical need: it is
        knowledge, not for the sake of knowledge, but for the sake of action,
        and the rule of conduct. Scientific investigation is permitted only so
        far as it lays down the true place and position of man in the world of
        things.</p>
        <p align="justify">And this exclusion of extraneous considerations may
        be presented under another aspect. If there are any sciences which deal
        with words and ideas rather than things <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>and the sciences of rhetoric, grammar,
        and mathematics come in different ways under this description <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>then application to their study can
        only be held to be waste of time. They divert attention from the one
        thing needful. The human soul cannot find nourishment in mere words: it
        craves for realities. Epicurus, following up certain ideas which
        Socrates had emphasized, asks of every science, Does it deal with facts?
        and is it useful to me as a human being? If it does not, it may possibly
        be the pastime of an idle hour; but it should never claim the devotion
        of a life, because it makes a man miss his true good. It should never be
        forgotten, therefore, that the natural philosophy of Epicurus is the
        foundation of his ethics; its <i>raison d'être</i> is, that it renders
        possible a theory of conduct.</p>
        <p align="justify">Besides these two parts of the system, however, there
        is another, which may be styled introductory. It deals with the general
        principles on which we are entitled to assert anything. This is the
        Canonic, the doctrine of the canons, or grounds of evidence. But the
        Canonic can scarcely be said to form an independent part of
        Epicureanism: it goes little beyond a few general and preliminary
        remarks on the question, &quot;What right have we to believe or
        affirm?&quot; It is, in short, a protest against the scepticism which
        declares that every statement is uncertain, and science only a
        probability; and which maintains that, in these circumstances, the only
        thing left for man is to keep himself free and unshackled from all
        one-sided adherence. The Canonic is thus the beginning of a logic,
        dealing, not with the grounds for inferring one proposition from
        another, but with the more fundamental question: On what ultimate
        grounds is a statement of fact based?</p>
        <p align="justify">The three parts of Epicureanism are, then, Logic,
        Physics, and Ethics, if we apply to Epicureanism the distinction which
        had been applied by the Stoics to the doctrines of their own school.
        But, at the same time, the terms are infinitely misleading when so
        applied. Of logic, in the sense in which the term was understood by
        Aristotle and the Stoics, there was none in Epicureanism. Nor was this
        all. The Epicureans regarded it as folly, as unnecessary trifling with
        useless questions. Still less, again, is there a distinction between the
        Epicurean physics and ethics as independent or parallel branches of
        inquiry.</p>
        <p align="justify">The case stands thus: The Epicurean school professes,
        in the first instance, to be founded on the senses and the feeling, to
        be based on reality, as popularly understood. It appeals to our
        immediate perception and feeling, and declares that these must never be
        recklessly set aside. What we immediately feel and perceive, that is
        true; what we directly find ourselves to be, that is what we ought to
        do. <i>Act what thou art </i>is its motto, and sense and feeling tell
        thee with sufficient distinctness what thou art. But the promise thus
        held out is certainly not kept to the letter. What we supposed to be our
        feelings and sensations turn out to be less trustworthy than we had
        been, up to this point, led to suppose. The greater number of our
        beliefs and opinions are due to hasty and erroneous inferences. What
        seemed to be perception was really reasoning. We must, therefore, get
        back to our original perceptions. We were told originally that we must
        believe nothing for which we have not the evidence of the senses and the
        feeling. It becomes apparent that that evidence does not go so far as we
        had supposed. Our senses and our feelings seem to mislead, and yet, if
        we reject all sense and feeling, knowledge is made impracticable.</p>
        <p align="justify">In other words, the world is not as it seems: all our
        perceptions cannot, without examination or qualification, be relied
        upon. This, however, is only because in our perceptions there constantly
        intrudes an element which is not sense. The other element, which is
        truly sense, is infallible.<a HREF="#notes05"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp; All
        our sensations are witnesses to reality, only liable to be
        misinterpreted. Above all, there is a great deal which is inaccessible
        to direct observation altogether. But though it is unknown, the human
        mind cannot let it alone. Hence arises the need of a canon of inference,
        which is given as follows: everything that is supposed to happen in the
        sphere beyond knowledge must follow the same laws of operation as what
        is known to occur within the range of our experience.</p>
        <p align="justify">Whether it happen in what is beneath the range of the
        senses (i.e., in the microscopic world, and what lies beyond the power
        of the microscope), or beyond the range of the senses (i.e., in the
        telescopic world, and what lies beyond the reach of the telescope), it
        is governed by the same laws as regulate the occurrences visible to
        unaided sense.</p>
        <p align="justify">The canonic thus justifies those inferences which go
        beyond sense. It is right and just to affirm about the unknown, either
        what is confirmed and witnessed by the known, or what at least is not
        witnessed against by the known.<a HREF="#notes05"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;
        But, at the same time, it is well to note in which sense the reason is
        here said to go beyond the sense. It goes beyond simply quantitatively:
        it carries us further and deeper, but there is a general likeness
        between the one case and the other. The atoms, e.g., which are
        intellectually perceived, have precisely the same qualities as the
        bodies which are sensibly perceived, when we deduct from the latter all
        which can be shown to be the effect of a combination of circumstances.
        The intellect is only a subtler and more far-seeing sense, and the sense
        is a short-sighted and grosser intellect. In Epicurean phraseology, in
        fact, the particles which constitute the one are said to be finer and
        more ethereal than those which constitute the other; and for that
        reason, and that reason only, they are susceptible to minute influences,
        to which the grosser particles composing the senses are stolidly
        insensible.<a HREF="#notes05"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">The Epicurean logic, then, if logic it can be called,
        is in the direction of inductive logic. It lays down the senses as the
        first, and, we may say, the ultimate court of appeal as a criterion of
        reality. They never can be mistaken, though the mind may be wrong in the
        inferences it draws from them. This is the first principle; and the
        second is, that the unknown is regulated by the same laws as the known:
        that is to say, the operations in the world invisible to the senses
        follow on a larger or less scale the same principles as govern the
        operations of the visible world. We do not, in the intelligible world,
        find ourselves lifted into a world where new categories and higher
        conceptions prevail. Thirdly, language in the Epicurean logic is
        subjected to scrutiny. Every word, if it is to pass muster in argument,
        must be <i>en rapport</i> with a clear and distinct conception, which
        again must finally be based upon one clear and distinct perception.<sup><a href="#notes05">10</a></sup>&nbsp;
        These are the three main principles of Canonic: that sensation is the
        only guarantee of reality, that language must be able to recall distinct
        images, and that reasoning must employ known and familiar processes to
        make unknown and mysterious facts explicable.</p>

        logical principles prepare the way for the physiology or natural
        philosophy of Epicurus. Beginning with the senses, we ask what the
        senses reveal? The answer is, that the only phenomenon which they reveal
        is matter in motion. This double conception is the groundwork of all
        Epicurean philosophy, the main effort of which is to reduce everything
        to modes of matter and motion. Matter is the sole reality: movement is
        the generic form to which all its phenomena may ultimately be reduced.
        The incorporeal is the same as the non-existent. Epicurus departs from
        Aristotle, to follow the doctrines taught by Anaxagoras and Democritus.
        &quot;Generation and destruction,&quot; said Anaxagoras,<a HREF="#notes06"><sup>1</sup></a>
        &quot;are mistaken ideas amongst the Greeks. For generation, the right
        term would be composition; and for destruction, separation.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Matter is that which can be touched. Touch, says
        Lucretius, is the sense of body.<a HREF="#notes06"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;
        The tangible, both in the active and the passive application of that
        term, is the corporeal. All the senses are but modifications of touch:
        only what we can touch and what can touch us has reality. Touch, again,
        is impact upon the organ of sense, and is thus only a special case of
        the more general phenomenon of impact. Impact is body moving and causing
        motion. And thus we are brought round to a conception of things in which
        we find body acting upon body, so as, generally speaking, to cause
        motion; in some special cases, however, giving rise to another
        phenomenon, to be called sensation or intelligence. The latter
        phenomenon may, however, for the present be left out of account.
        Epicurus, so far as we know, as little succeeded in explaining the
        connection, if any, between this exceptional, and, so to speak,
        collateral result of impact, and the general phenomena of movement, as
        any of his predecessors or successors have done.</p>
        <p align="justify">According to Epicurus, the only facts of which
        philosophy can take account are material, tangible things. Mind, if
        real, is tangible somehow, is a kind of matter. Immaterial mind would be
        a nonentity. Obviously, however, everything depends on what we mean by
        matter. The popular conception of matter takes things too concretely,
        and with too little analysis. It follows the deliverances of the
        uninstructed senses, which present things as qualitatively distinct from
        each other. We must go to the reason to reconcile and explain the
        imperfect information thus given by the senses. We must see behind the
        differences of colour, taste, smell, of vegetable and animal
        organization, of life and death, into the ultimate something, of which
        these are only manifestations, due to transient and accidental
        conditions. What, then, is the verdict of the reason, as contrasted with
        the senses?</p>
        <p align="justify">Every body is composed of a greater or smaller number
        of atoms, or indivisible particles, in various degrees of proximity to
        each other. What appears to be solid is never absolutely so. The air,
        the water, the fruit, the rock, have all an atomic or molecular
        constitution. The tiny particles of which they are composed float in an
        ocean of empty space, where the are forced into closer or laxer
        proximity to each other. How small these atoms are we cannot tell. They
        are cognisable by reason and thought, but they are beneath the power of
        sense, at least of unassisted sense. Whether further aids to perception
        might reveal them is a question apparently not suggested to Epicurus.
        But of such elementary particles every existing structure has been built
        up: into such it will sooner or later return. Nor is the process limited
        to the world we see around us. We have no reason to suppose there is a
        limit set to existence at the furthest point whither our vision can
        carry us. Away and away beyond the horizon of the senses, the same
        process of the construction of worlds out of molecular aggregations is
        endlessly repeated. It would be as absurd to suppose only one world in
        the infinite as to conceive a great cornfield with only a single stalk
        of grain in it.<a HREF="#notes06"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">A question, however, arises about the movement of the
        atoms. The only case of apparently uncaused movement is the fall of
        unsupported bodies to the earth. That fall takes place in a straight
        line. Neither the circular movement, which Aristotle holds to be the
        natural and perfect movement of the celestial bodies, nor the upward
        movement which, in his opinion, characterizes fire, correspond in the
        judgment of Epicurus with the observed facts of terrestrial change.
        Upward movement is a mistake. As for circular movement, it is explained
        by subsequent science as a conjunction of two rectilineal movements
        acting at right angles to each other. We cannot, therefore, assume an
        initial tendency of atoms to attract or repel each other, or to revolve
        round each other. But, in apparent conformity with experience, we may
        assume that the atoms fall downwards. Of course, an up and a down in a
        vacant world can only be arbitrarily fixed,<a HREF="#notes06"><sup>4</sup></a>
        and a modern would object that every fall presupposed attraction. But
        Epicurus is content with the phenomenon of fall as experienced in daily
        life: he asks for no cause of the movement so denominated, but regards
        it as natural and primary. Thus, in the primeval void, all atoms are
        perpetually falling. To assume more would be to affix active properties
        to the atoms; but such properties the atoms, however erratic, as we
        shall see, have none. But if these bodies perpetually fall in parallel
        lines, never overtaking each other, because of equal velocity,<a HREF="#notes06"><sup>5</sup></a>
        they will practically just remain where they were in equilibrium. All we
        gain is a picture of atoms flitting after each other across the field of
        imagination; but, for any result so arising, except weariness of the
        continuous fall into the abyss, the atoms might as well remain at rest.
        To a theory which places its ultimates in atoms which have no further
        qualities than shape and size (so as to make them picturable), it is
        evident that attraction and repulsion are obscure and occult ideas. To
        accept their aid towards an explanation of movement would be to
        surrender the citadels of the system. It seems, therefore, as if the
        molecular equilibrium would remain eternal, in the absence of a
        sufficient cause to bring the atoms in contact.</p>
        <p align="justify">The senses and the feelings, however, suggest a way
        out of the difficulty. In our own experience as conscious beings we seem
        familiar with the fact that not unfrequently we suddenly change the
        direction of our action; we swerve from the line in which obvious
        motives were urging us; we form a new resolution and break up an old
        habit. We seem to recognise in ourselves a principle of spontaneous and
        sudden change, an incalculable spring of deviation, a power of resisting
        and contradicting the tendency impressed upon us by circumstances and
        fortune.&nbsp; In this power which we feel ourselves to have <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>we find a suggestion towards removing
        the difficulty. In the atom, then, Epicurus assumes the existence of a
        similar incalculable and unpredictable element which, some time (we know
        not when) and some where (we know not where), either once or oftener
        (our authorities do not answer the question), impels the atom from its
        previous direction. The amount of the divergence from the perpendicular
        is, like all qualities connected with the magnitude of the atoms, an
        infinitesimally small one. And the reason for minimising the deflection
        is obvious. If we allow it to become so great as to be observable, the
        phenomenon of motion in an oblique direction thus created would openly
        contradict the well-known experience that all uncaused motion is
        naturally perpendicular.</p>
        <p align="justify">By means of this <i>clinamen</i> or <i>&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#769;&#947;&#954;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#962;</i>
        of the molecules,<a HREF="#notes06"><sup>6</sup></a> Epicurus at once
        tries to retain the spontaneity of individual action or the superiority
        of man to circumstances, and at the same time, in his explanation of the
        primeval conditions of contact between the atoms, shrinks from running
        too openly counter to the recognised experience of material movement.
        Let us assume, then, that his purpose has been attained. The molecules,
        small and great, of one shape or another, meet with each other; and
        their impact is followed by various consequences. Sometimes they are
        mutually repelled, and fly off to other spaces; sometimes they are
        locked in by circumambient atoms and forced to juxtaposition; sometimes
        their peculiar shape, weight, and size, make them to cohere closely
        together and form combinations of considerable permanence and stability.
        In this way the spaces of infinity are parcelled out into innumerable
        folds containing large aggregations of matter in various shapes and
        structures. In such an enormous aggregation, which may be called a
        world, there are several tolerably united bodies, composed each of a
        number of molecules in aggregation, but not in any case in absolutely
        close contact. Everywhere between the molecules there is empty
        space-absolute vacuum. The densest, heaviest, hardest body has less
        vacuum within it than a rare, light, or soft piece of matter; but vacuum
        is never completely wanting. Nothing therefore is ever a complete unity;
        it only seems to be continuous and whole: really, if we could look deep
        enough into it, we should see that it is only a collection of parts held
        together by the fortuitous influences of circumstance.</p>
        <p align="justify">Such combinations or aggregations however exhibit a
        number of phenomena which were not found in the elements from which they
        sprung. Great, indeed, is the virtue of aggregation. The original atoms
        were extended bodies, too small singly to be perceived by sense, and
        differing from each other in no points besides figure, size, and weight.
        But, as every one is aware, a difference of size or weight or shape may
        often lead to differences which seem quite other than quantitative. So
        is it here. In the first place, as we have already noticed, it leads to
        the explanation of the distinction between mind and body. Epicurus is,
        as will be seen, a materialist, and so far as he goes is in earnest with
        his materialism. That is to say, he does not merely ignore the mind: he
        expounds it, <i>i.e.</i> the basis of psychical phenomena, to be a finer
        species of matter composed of rounder and minuter particles. It is true
        that he introduces a further subtlety by distinguishing between the
        soul, or principle of life and feeling which pervades the whole body,
        and the rational mind which inhabits the region of the heart. Sufficient
        is it to remember for the present that the soul is a subtler and more
        refined materiality which is thus endowed with more delicate and refined
        perceptions than the bodily organs.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the second place, life and sensibility are the
        characteristics of certain forms of aggregate matter. Epicurus does not,
        like a modern, fictitiously get over the difficulty by introducing the
        term organized, but honestly enough maintains the general uniformity in
        the process of aggregation in all parts of nature as a thing differing
        in degree, not in kind. He simply asserts <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>what, no doubt, is the fact <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>that certain (or uncertain)
        combinations of the primeval molecules present the phenomena of life and
        consciousness which are entirely absent from the original molecules
        themselves. How such a remarkable result can be produced is a question
        which apparently never occurred to him; and he therefore did not feel
        any need of recurring to hypotheses like those by which modern
        speculators have endeavoured to exhibit mind or consciousness as the
        development of latent possibilities in the unconscious matter.<a HREF="/l%201"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;
        It may also be hinted that Epicurus, unintentionally perhaps, did
        service to the psychologist by maintaining that the processes in the
        human organism which are the physical concomitants or antecedents of
        thought and sensation are distinctly mechanical processes of matter in
        motion. Ignorant, however, of the structure of the brain and the laws of
        nervous action, he could give only a rough-and-ready hypothetical
        explanation of the mode of transmission of sense-impressions and
        volitions through the organism.</p>
        <p align="justify">Perhaps, too, we may notice what seems in his
        doctrine of the mind at once to betray a departure from his original
        principles and a sense of the inadequacy of his explanation. According
        to the statements given both by Diogenes Laertius and Lucretius, the
        soul is a complex of elements from air, fire, and wind, and a fourth
        unnamed element.<a HREF="#notes06"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp; The last,
        which is the differentiating constituent of the mind, suggests that it
        is postulated by the feeling that there is more in the psychical than
        physical analogies altogether explain. And further, the introduction of
        air, fire, and wind, suggests that Epicurus supplements the stricter
        atomic theory of Democritus by additions derived from the early
        physicists who identify the soul with air, or fire, or wind; and from
        Aristotle, in whose system the combination of the four principles of
        cold, hot, wet, and dry, played a main part, as explaining the processes
        of nature.</p>
        <p align="justify">But, passing on to a further point in the results of
        combination, we have now to consider the way in which Epicurus explained
        the fact that the visible world is supposed to possess colour, sound,
        taste, smell, softness, &amp;c. To do this is partly the aim of the
        Epicurean theory of sense-perception. In every body of matter, every
        object of perception, there is, besides the primary particles of which
        it is composed, a further complement of secondary particles of finer
        quality, partly maintaining a position over the whole of its
        superficies, partly existing in the interior interstices between its
        constituent atoms. These minor molecules, which vary from body to body,
        are in a continual flux; they are always floating away from the body to
        which they belong, and wandering aimlessly hither and thither about the
        world. For a considerable length of time these filmy membranes, which
        bodies are continually throwing off, preserve the shape and arrangement
        they possessed on the original body; though, of course, in time, if they
        meet with obstructions, as they are sure to do, they will be broken up,
        and lose all resemblance to their present frame-work. Those films which
        are sloughed off the surface of bodies find in the visual organs an
        appropriate medium; they penetrate the eye, and, preserving the position
        they had in the object, cause the mind to see the latter, even though
        distant. By their direct contact they reveal the distant objects which
        they resemble. Similarly, the throngs of filmy particles from the
        interior of bodies when they happen to meet a nose, reveal the smell of
        the body; when they meet an ear, produce the perception of sound; and
        when they touch the tongue, lead to the perception of the body's taste.
        Thus colour, sounds, tastes, are not qualities of primary body; they are
        only found where minutest particles from the real bodies come into
        contact with the organs of sense<a HREF="#notes06"><sup>9</sup></a> in
        an animal structure.</p>
        <p align="justify">How absurd this theory is we need hardly trouble
        ourselves to explain. It gets rid of mathematical optics by a return to
        rude, primitive fancies of the barbarian age. It refuses to be satisfied
        with any such makeshifts as are afforded by the mathematical assumption
        of immaterial rays of light, and the still more awkward assumption of
        material pencils of rays. It certainly recognises the doctrine already
        laid down by Democritus, and in modern times re-asserted by Galileo and
        Locke, of the profound distinction between the primary qualities of body
        (figure, size, &amp;c.) and the secondary, such as colour, sound, taste,
        &amp;c. The latter, as it points out, only belong to matter in so far as
        it comes into contact with organisms peculiarly sentient.&nbsp; But all
        this doctrine of sense-perception is in a way only part of a larger
        doctrine which has important and direct bearings on the moral theory.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the first place, not merely do the skins shed by
        the objects around us meet the eye now; but, even long after the objects
        to which they may have belonged have ceased to exist, these phantom
        husks float about the world. Thus it happens that the forms of the
        departed may visit us long after their decease. They may occur to us
        even in daylight, when our attention is not engrossed by terrestrial
        business, and when, in the dead of night, our eyes are closed to the
        objects around us. Such is the Epicurean explanation of ghosts: they are
        disembodied films or loose skins, like those the insect leaves upon the
        bushes after its transition to other forms.</p>
        <p align="justify">And, secondly, there are probably such gatherings (<i>&#963;&#965;&#963;&#964;á&#963;&#949;&#962;</i>)
        sometimes formed in the void which do not owe their origin to any real
        bodies at all, are not thrown off from any surface, but are fortuitous
        and casual gatherings accumulated without cause or reason, and assuming
        the shapes of familiar objects. Such fantastic forms, or mirages,
        deceive the unwary traveller. Thus what optical science explains by
        complicated processes of reflection and refraction, and by premature
        interpretations of the observer, Epicureanism explains by an hypothesis
        quite in agreement with its own doctrines and partly compatible with
        observed facts, but unnecessarily multiplying the causes and entities

        results of the same eternal laws which have produced the rest of things.<sup><a href="#notes06b">11</a></sup></p>
        <p align="justify">This doctrine, which, as it were, explained away the
        popular religion and theology, is one of the most striking, but also one
        of the darkest in the Epicurean system. It admits, and even asseverates,
        the existence of the gods, but it minimises the importance of the
        admission by refusing to the beings thus acknowledged to exist all
        influence or government over human affairs. The fear of God is thus
        removed, obviously at the price of losing the love of God also. Man has
        no longer a tyrant in the heavens; but he has no longer a friend there.
        As for the latter part of the sentence, indeed, the idea was scarcely
        likely to occur to a Greek of the age of Epicurus, who considered the
        popular mythology only; and it is evident that Lucretius never
        entertained the thought of such a possibility. The tenants of the
        heathen heaven were beings to be propitiated, entreated, dreaded, and
        not to be loved. Nor did such an idea of God as that taught by Plato and
        other lofty minds, according to which He is the cause of good, and good
        only, the ideal of justice and goodness and truth, ever largely find
        entrance into the popular creed. Even Plato himself departs from his
        conception, and presents Deity as an avenger and an executioner of
        judgment. The doctrine of Epicurus offered an explanation of the
        wide-spread belief in the existence of divine beings, but so emptied
        that belief of practical significance that in popular estimation the
        Epicureans were naturally, though not very fairly, treated as atheists.<a HREF="#notes06b"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">Connected with this was the question of existence
        after death, and of future punishment. Whatever may have been the case
        in earlier ages of Greece, there is no doubt that in the age of Epicurus
        the doctrine of a judgment to come, and of a hell where sinners were
        punished for their crimes, made a large part of the vulgar creed. The
        sixth book of Virgil's Æneid, with its faint outlines of an inferno, is
        still a great advance in gloom upon the rather neutral tints of the
        eleventh book of the Odyssey. Orphic and other religious sects had
        enhanced the terrors of the world below; whilst they had done very
        little towards the provision of a heaven, except for those who conformed
        to their own special rites. This gloomy prospect beyond the grave
        aggravated and embittered the natural fears of death. Against such fears
        the Epicurean doctrine of the relation of soul to body claimed to supply
        a safeguard. It laid down as its cardinal dogma the interdependence of
        soul and body, neither of which continues to exist after the connexion
        has been severed at death. When the soul leaves the body, it is
        dispersed into unconscious elements: when the body is left without soul,
        it ere long moulders away into other forms of existence.</p>
        <p align="justify">The dissolved elements of the living being are
        insensible to pain or pleasure.<a HREF="#notes06b"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;
        The Epicureans apparently believed that death was divested of its
        terrors, when that &quot;dread of something after death,&quot; which
        &quot;puzzles the will,&quot; was declared to be groundless.</p>
        <p align="justify">The removal in this way of the fears of the gods and
        of the fears of death is the preliminary condition and preparation for
        the practical lessons of Epicurus. These are the two main results to
        which the natural philosophy has led up. As such they form the two first
        aphorisms of the Articles: &quot;I. The blessed and incorruptible has no
        toil or trouble of its own, and causes none to others. It is not subject
        either to anger or favour.&nbsp; II. Death is nothing to us. That into
        which dissolution brings us has no feeling or consciousness, and what
        has no consciousness is nothing to us.&quot;<sup><a HREF="#notes06b">14</a>&nbsp;
        </sup>These declarations set human life free, as it were, from all
        controlling powers in the heavens, or in the dim hereafter. By two
        tremendous strokes, Epicurus cut the Gordian knot of destiny,
        emancipated man from divine control, and bade him freely concentrate
        himself on the present life without any thought of consequences beyond
        the tomb.</p>
        <p align="justify">So eager was Epicurus to exclude all possibility of
        divine interference in the world that he gave with great detail a series
        of suggestions for the hypothetical explanation on non-theological
        principles of the celestial and meteorological phenomena. It is in these
        occurrences, belonging, as Epicurus thought, to a sphere where science
        is impossible, that the mythological explanation by direct divine
        causation is most at home. The phenomena of eclipses, for example, have
        seemed to many barbarous peoples a calamity overtaking their deities, or
        an expression of divine anger; and even in less rude ages the popular
        mind is reluctant to believe that the meteorological changes are no more
        and no less directly in the hands of Providence than the presence or
        absence of a gold-mine in a particular district. The letter of Pythocles
        (in Diogenes Laertius) and the fifth and sixth books of Lucretius's poem
        exhibit with much curious fulness this aspect of Epicureanism. At first
        sight, it is one of the strangest features of a strange system. We begin
        with the amazing doctrine that, rather than let slip a palpable fact, a
        false explanation is preferable to any view which leaves deity free to
        interpose its agency. But a second principle seems still more counter to
        the spirit and methods of science. A warning is loudly uttered against
        any doctrine which states one single and uniform explanation of the
        celestial and meteorological phenomena; and there is presented, on the
        contrary, an embarrassing choice of alternative hypotheses.</p>
        <p align="justify">A few examples may be given of the way in which
        Epicurus seeks to keep out the hypothesis of deity as a physical cause.
        To begin with, we are told that the sun is about the same size as it
        appears,<a HREF="#notes06b"><sup>15</sup></a> which at once disposes of
        the astronomical theories of Eudoxus and the Pythagorean school. Next we
        find the earth made the centre of our world, and the sun, moon, and
        stars, reduced to insignificant attendants upon it. In these statements
        the apparent fact is taken as the final truth. We now come to the
        assumptions rendered necessary in consequence of such premises.
        &quot;The rising and setting of the sun and moon and stars may be due to
        the lighting and the extinction of these bodies; they may also be due to
        other causes. Their movements may not impossibly be due to the
        revolution of the whole heaven, or to their own revolution whilst the
        heaven remains at rest. The waning and waxing of the moon may be due to
        the turning of that body; they may also be due to certain formations of
        air, to the intervention of another object, and in all the ways in which
        the terrestrial phenomena in our midst suggest an explanation of these
        changes of form <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        method of explanation (<i>&#956;&#959;&#957;&#945;&#967;ò&#962;
        &#964;&#961;&#960;&#959;&#962;</i>) that he rejects all others, having
        failed to perceive that some things are accessible to human science and
        others not, and in that way tries to solve insoluble problems.&quot;<a HREF="#notes06b"><sup>16</sup></a>
        All the explanations given by all the physical philosophers of antiquity
        meet in Epicurus as possible theories so far as they are in harmony with
        familiar phenomena.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus, however, has another opponent in view
        throughout this letter <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:

        than the mythologists. That opponent is Fate (<i>&#949;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#949;&#769;&#957;&#951;</i>).
        The doctrine of divine interference may be bad; the doctrine of fatalism
        is worse. Epicurus will have neither. He rises up against the dogma of a
        universal law welding all the parts of the world into a gigantic machine
        in which human beings are involved. Unlike Aristotle,<a HREF="#notes06b"><sup>17</sup></a>
        who quotes with approval the Homeric line which holds that &quot;many
        masters is not a good thing: let there be one ruler,&quot; he would
        rather see the several provinces of nature democratically independent of
        any central despotism. To him the recurrent phenomena of the universe
        are not results of a united plan: they are to him, after all, only
        contingencies. The sun rises and sets regularly only because the
        combination of elements evolves that particular chance again and again
        with an approximation to uniformity. There is no controlling design
        which all the movements of the universe cooperate in their several parts
        to execute and realise. Each event, therefore, has, as it were, to stand
        by itself and be explained on its own merits. But a science of the
        events of the meteorological and astronomic sphere has been declared
        impossible for man: all that he need hope for or care for is to get a
        plausible explanation conforming to the well-known canon, that it must
        either be confirmed by familiar experience, or, at least, not be
        contravened by such experience. So he shall not tremble as if the
        thunder were the voice of angry gods, or the thunderbolt a minister of
        divine vengeance upon the wicked.</p>
        <p align="justify">Throughout the whole of his explanation of the origin
        of the earth and of the arts and civilization of the inhabitants,
        Epicurus is careful to exclude any reference to divine action. There was
        no design, no plan determining beforehand the process of evolution, and
        adapting one part of the cosmic structure to co-operate with another.
        The sun was not formed that he might serve the uses of man, vivifying
        and fertilizing the earth by his rays. In all its phases teleology is
        extruded. The very animals which are found upon the earth have been made
        what they are by slow processes of selection and adaptation through the
        experience of life. &quot;Many races of animals,&quot; says Lucretius,
        &quot;must have perished and failed to propagate their kind. Those which
        we see at present alive owe their continued existence to their superior
        cunning or their bravery or their speed; whilst others have been
        preserved because they were found useful to men.&quot;<a HREF="#notes06b"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp;
        According to the same theory, which is ultra-Darwinian in its character,
        there must often, in the early ages of the world, when complex forms
        first casually arose, have been seen strange mixtures of unaccordant
        limbs and diverse natures, which, however, were unable to maintain
        themselves and so passed away.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of course, in this there is no implication of the
        peculiarly Darwinian doctrine of descent, or development of kind from
        kind, with structure modified and complicated to meet changing
        circumstances. Natural selection of those species which were favoured by
        their qualities or by circumstances in the competition for life is no
        doubt affirmed by Epicurus, as it had been by Empedocles and others
        before him. But the point on which he chiefly insists is the naturalness
        of the organic world. Plants and animals have the same source as rocks
        and sands. It is from the seeds or elements contained in the earth that
        the animals have in some strange maternal throes (as Lucretius somewhat
        figuratively puts it) been evolved in their season: they have not fallen
        from heaven.<a HREF="#notes06b"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp; The same
        naturalistic explanation is given of the special endowments of human
        beings. The organs of sense were not given us ready-made in order that
        we might use them: that which is born in our body, on the contrary,
        generates for itself a use.<a HREF="#notes06b"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp;
        The structure, for example, which we call the eye was not given us as an
        organ of vision: it arose, we need not too curiously inquire how, and it
        was found to be useful for the perception of objects in the light.

        Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">Similar considerations explain how man came to have
        language. Words originally were not conventional symbols: the first
        words were natural utterances of man corresponding to the cries peculiar
        to every species of animal, and signified the objects and scenes around
        him as they happened to gratify or excite his wants and feelings. These
        utterances naturally varied in proportion to the variety of national
        characters and of individual human beings, and to the peculiar images
        excited. In this way, in different regions, a special form arose in
        which the air was expelled from the lips and the sound formed. Different
        nations made different languages. Within the same nation special
        utterances came to be recognized by the whole community as expressive of
        one fixed object or occurrence, and so was avoided the ambiguity which
        would have supervened if no agreement were made. What was thus begun in
        reference to visible objects was extended subsequently so as to denote
        objects not accessible to sense: sounds were appropriated to invisible
        objects: and the mass of the people adopted the terms thus introduced,
        either from compulsion or by conviction of the reasonableness of the
        proposal.<sup><a HREF="#notes06c">21</a></sup></p>

        Not that Epicurus is a pessimist, or that he believes the net result of
        existence to be a preponderance of evil. If we can apply either term
        safely to him, we should rather say that Epicurus was optimist, or his
        whole doctrine of the aim and end of life must be treated as illusory
        and misleading. He holds that, whatever the chances of life are, and in
        whatever direction they may preponderate, it is always in the power of
        reasonable men, if they will, to make all things work together for
        happiness. But to this end it is essential that man should not have his

        we are our own masters, so far, at least, that no overmastering destiny
        drags us along in its train whether we will or not. The gods have left
        man alone. Is it possible even, asks Lucretius, that any being, however
        wise and powerful, can have his eyes on all the corners of the earth at
        once? At any rate, it is not the case that the immortals interfere. Man
        has his hands free to scale the heavens and make himself blessed as the
        gods.</p>
        <p align="justify">Has man, then, according to Epicurus, a free will? It
        is, perhaps, hazardous, in the scanty supply of evidence, to attempt a
        categorical answer to the question. Except a brief reference in
        Lucretius and Diogenes, and a somewhat ambiguous passage in the recently
        recovered fragments of Epicurus himself, there is nothing specially
        fixing the problem one way or another.<a HREF="#notes06c"><sup>25</sup></a>&nbsp;
        It is true that we may argue from other principles of his system. Too
        much reliance, however, may be placed on such consistency. It is
        perfectly conceivable that a philosopher while binding Nature fast in
        fate may leave the human will free; and so, although Epicureanism, in
        its theory of perception, <i>seems</i> to reduce the mind to a mere
        re-agent for the various <i>idola</i>, or <i>spectra</i>, which flood in
        upon it from outward sources, it need not follow that he denied all
        spontaneity to the mind. Rather, this last question he does not appear
        to have touched. When Lucretius, for example, approaches it in his
        argument, and asks how a man comes to think of one particular object and
        not some other, he simply alludes, as if it were in need of no
        explanation, to the circumstance of the mind being able to attend, to
        abstract, to concentrate itself. In other words, he takes for granted a

        free-will controversy, if it be an intelligible dispute at all, and not
        rather a battle in which each side fights not against the other, but
        against an imaginary enemy of its own creation, had scarcely formulated
        itself definitely in his time. What Epicurus has in view seems to be on
        the one hand a popular illusion, and on the other a metaphysical dogma.
        The popular illusion is a belief in the efficacy of chance or fortune;
        the metaphysical dogma is that of fatalism, or necessitarianism.
        According to the Stoics, who derived their doctrine from Plato and
        Aristotle, every act and event is regarded as part of a vast
        pre-ordained order from the bonds of which there is no escape. <i>Fata</i>,
        says Seneca, <i>volentem ducunt, nolentem trahunt</i> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>&quot;The willing are led, the
        unwilling dragged by the fates.&quot; But willing or unwilling must
        alike testify to the supremacy of destiny. Our fancied independence is
        the veil which we draw over our inevitable participation in the great
        circles of the wheel of providential doom. It is against this lordship
        of the universal law that Epicurus raises his protest. For him there is
        no law higher than the law of kind; each species has its appointed
        limits, which it cannot transgress if it is to live and flourish. But
        there is no higher law to which the species is subject <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        </span>except the law
        of chance, which presides at the formation of kinds and of worlds. It
        enters into no grand plan, makes part of no system. So long as it obeys
        its own laws it is free. And such is the freedom of man. To recognize
        the end or limit of his nature, and to gain freedom by acting in
        constant accordance with the conditions thus discerned, is the part of
        the wise man, of the philosopher.</p>
        <p align="justify">On the other hand, man is not the mere creature of
        chances, and least of all in proportion to his progress in wisdom.
        Intelligence renders him superior to fortune, or at least diminishes to
        the lowest point the effects of chance and circumstance. Within the
        limits laid down by his own specific nature, man may, if he will, be
        above all external forces. Thus Epicurus contemns both fate and chance.
        However much he indicates that in a formed character the actions flow
        from self as a concentrated and self-contained cause, while in an
        unformed and immature being they are a varying resultant of passions
        from within and impressions from without, still there is a residuum of
        spontaneity which he seems unwilling to ignore, though unable to
        explain. Man, like the atoms, has something incalculable in him; even as
        in the soul there was a fourth &quot;unnamed&quot; essence. The
        anonymous and the spontaneous lurk at the bottom of these explanations.</p>
        <p align="justify">Neither in life nor in death, therefore, can anything
        entail defeat or cause a regret for the wise man who has freed himself
        from the blindness born in his flesh, and learned what humanity really
        requires. &quot;The reasonable man,&quot; says Philodemus, in his
        treatise on Death, &quot;having learnt that he can acquire all that is
        needed for a happy life, from that moment, having, as it were, prepared
        himself for burial, walks about and reaps profit from a single day as if
        it were an age.&quot;<a HREF="#notes06c"><sup>26</sup></a> Once for all
        he dismisses the thought of death from his mind when he has once for all
        grasped its necessity and the utter indifference to us of the state
        which succeeds it. &quot;The free man,&quot; says Spinoza, &quot;thinks
        of nothing less than of death, and his wisdom is not a meditation of
        death, but of life.&quot;<a HREF="#notes06c"><sup>27</sup></a> Convinced
        that death is an absolute end with no other life beyond, his motto is
        not, as is vulgarly said, &quot;Eat, drink, for tomorrow we die&quot;;
        but he argues that, though we may die to-morrow, still the fear of death
        should not poison and embitter today.</p>
        <p align="justify">The annihilation of the personality by death is not
        an idea peculiar to the Epicureans; it appears in ancient writers in
        various tones, from solemn enthusiasm to frivolous mockery. The
        passionate rejection of immortality by the elder Pliny is well known.
        &quot;What accursed frenzy, to think that life is to be renewed by
        death. And where are those who have been brought into being ever to find
        rest, if the spirit retains its consciousness in the world on high, and
        the shade in the world below? Verily this sweet fancy wherewith men
        beguile themselves deprives us of the chief blessing of nature, destroys
        death, and doubles. the pain of dying by reflection on what is to be
        hereafter. For, even if present life is sweet, who can find it sweet to <i>have</i>
        lived? How much easier and surer were it for each to believe himself,
        and to take his experience of the time that preceded his birth as an
        argument that he need feel no anxiety for the future?&quot;<a HREF="#notes06c"><sup>28</sup></a>&nbsp;
        In the second and third centuries, the phrases, &quot;To security,&quot;
        &quot;To eternal rest,&quot; &quot;To everlasting sleep&quot; (<i>securitati,
        œternœ quieti, œterno somno</i>), are not unfrequently found on
        tombstones. The prospect of an utter end to existence seems to have been
        felt by some, of those times, as no gloomy idea, but as a welcome hope
        of unbroken and unending rest. In others, the gross sensuality of some
        aspects of Roman character is conspicuously displayed. &quot;I was
        nothing: I am nothing: and thou who art alive, eat, drink, play,
        come.&quot; &quot;All that is man's own is what he eats and drinks&quot;
        is the refrain of many of these inscriptions on the tombs.<a HREF="#notes06c"><sup>29</sup></a>&nbsp;
        In Greek epitaphs the denial of immortality is less obvious perhaps; but
        in all the thought is turned backward to the life that is past, and
        seldom to the life that is to come, and the seriousness of the tomb is
        for them not incompatible with a note of cheerfulness and even of mirth.</p>
        <p align="justify">Ancient philosophy was divided on the question of
        immortality. The school of Aristotle rejected the doctrine of personal
        existence after death; and though the Stoics in general approximated
        towards it, still Panaetius, the most original of their Roman adherents,
        departed in this as in so many other points from the doctrine of his
        school. With the Platonists, on the contrary, and especially with those
        who combined Platonic with Pythagorean ideas, the immortality of the
        soul was a cardinal tenet. But apart from philosophic opinion, two facts
        seem tolerably certain which bear upon this point. The great majority of
        the Greek and Roman world believed in some sort of after-existence; but
        they differed largely in the minutiae of belief. And, secondly, though
        the conceptions of the other world in general do not appear to have cast
        any prevailing gloom over this life, yet, if we can trust Plato,
        Epicurus, and Lucretius, the general conviction of a judgment to come,
        where the deeds done in this life would receive their reward and
        punishment, seems to have been widely felt, and to have been, for
        priests and prophets, a fruitful soil. Indulgences for sin, propitiation
        of impiety, sacramental atonement, not to mention magic and baser forms
        of superstition, flourished alongside of Epicureanism all through its
        career, and probably reached their maximum in the first and second
        centuries of the Christian era. For all such modes of salvation Epicurus
        declared there was no need. Man alone could save himself; he needed
        neither redeemer nor priest. To know and obey the law of Nature was the
        only and the certain way to happiness and goodness. If help were needed
        in the work of life, it could be found in the sympathy of a true friend.
        On earth was the portion of man: on earth blessedness could be either
        won or lost; and death closed all accounts. Goodness carried with it its
        present reward: the prize of virtue was not postponed.</p>

        now pass on to what would, in ordinary parlance, be described as the
        moral theory or ethical system of Epicurus. On this topic we get little
        help from Lucretius, whose poem breaks off before it has even completed
        the theory of natural phenomena. But in Diogenes Laertius, in Cicero and
        Seneca, there are a number of fragmentary statements, and even of
        tolerably connected passages, which help us to form in outline at least
        a conception of the Epicurean Ethics. But we must not expect too much
        from this title. We shall find no code of duties, no principle of
        obligation, no abstract standard of morals; and still less any
        discussion of the moral faculties. In morals we are referred as
        elsewhere to the guidance of feeling. In feeling, properly interpreted,
        we have our rule; and we have only to use our intellect to see that we
        are not led astray from obedience to its voice. Our feeling
        unequivocally tells us the general character of what we should pursue,
        viz., pleasure. It is the business of our reason to prevent this object
        being lost by injudicious pursuit, or by mistaking a less pleasure for a
        greater. Pleasure always is our aim; the natural aim of every living
        being, the end or law of nature. It needs some care, however, to
        discriminate real pleasure from pretended. We are corrupted, we inherit
        a perverse taste; and it is the office of philosophy to purify our
        feelings, to make our taste for pleasure true.</p>
        <p align="justify">As an introduction, we may take a letter of Epicurus
        in which he presents a summary of his theory of life and conduct; it is
        given by Diogenes Laertius:<a HREF="#notes07"><u><sup>1</sup></u></a></p>

          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Be not slack to seek wisdom when
          thou art young, nor weary in the search thereof when thou art grown
          old. For no age is too early or too late for the health of the soul.
          And he who says that the season for philosophy has not yet come, and
          that it is passed and gone, is like one who should say that the season
          for happiness has not yet come, or that it has passed away. Therefore,
          both old and young ought to seek wisdom, that so a man as age comes
          over him may be young in good things, because of the grace of what has
          been, and while he is young may likewise be old, because he has no
          fear of the things which are to come. Exercise thyself, therefore, in
          the things which bring happiness; for verily, while it is with thee
          thou wilt have everything, and when it is not, thou wilt do everything
          if so thou mayest have it.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Those things which without ceasing I
          have declared unto thee, those do and exercise thyself therein,
          holding them to be the elements of right life. First, believe that God
          is a being blessed and immortal, according to the notion of a God
          commonly held amongst men; and so believing, thou shalt not affirm of
          him aught that is contrary to immortality or that agrees not with
          blessedness, but shalt believe about him whatsoever may uphold both
          his blessedness and his immortality. For verily there are gods, and
          the knowledge of them is manifest; but they are not such as the
          multitude believe, seeing that men do not uphold steadfastly the
          notions they currently believe. Not the man who denies the gods
          worshipped by the multitude, but he who affirms of the gods what the
          multitude believes about them, is truly impious. For the utterances of
          the multitude about the gods are not true preconceptions, but false
          assumptions; according to which the greatest evils that happen to the
          wicked, and the blessings which happen to the good, are held to come
          from the hand of the gods. Seeing that, as they are always most
          familiar with their own good qualities, they take pleasure in the
          sight of qualities like their own, and reject as alien whatever is not
          of their kind.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Accustom thyself in the belief that
          death is nothing to us, for good and evil are only where they are
          felt, and death is the absence of all feeling: therefore, a right
          understanding that death is nothing to us makes enjoyable the
          mortality of life, not by adding to years an illimitable time, but by
          taking away the yearning after immortality. For in life there can be
          nothing to fear to him who has thoroughly apprehended that there is
          nothing to cause fear in what time we are not alive. Foolish,
          therefore, is the man who says that he fears death, not because it
          will pain when it comes, but because it pains in the prospect.
          Whatsoever causes no annoyance when it is present causes only a
          groundless pain by the expectation thereof. Death, therefore, the most
          awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that when we are, death is
          not yet, and when death comes, then we are not. It is nothing, then,
          either to the living or the dead, for it is not found with the living,
          and the dead exist no longer. But in the world, at one time men seek
          to escape death as the greatest of all evils, and at another time
          yearn for it as a rest from the evils in life. The mere absence of
          life is no object of fear, for to live is not set in view beside it,
          nor is it regarded as an evil. And even as men choose of food, not
          merely and simply the larger lot, but the most pleasant, so the wise
          seek to enjoy the time which is most pleasant, and not merely that
          which is longest. And he who admonishes the young men to live well,
          and the old men to make a good end, speaks foolishly, not merely
          because of the desirableness of life, but because the same exercise at
          once teaches to live well and to die well. Much worse is he who. says
          that it were best not to be born, but when once one is born, to pass
          with greatest speed the gates of Hades. If he, in truth, believes
          this, why does he not depart from this life? There is nothing to
          hinder him, if he has truly come to this conclusion. If he speaks only
          in mockery, his words are meaningless among people who believe in them
          not.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Thou must remember that the future
          is neither wholly ours, nor wholly not ours, so that neither may we
          wholly wait for it as if it were sure to come, nor wholly despair as
          if it were not to come.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Thou must also keep in mind that of
          desires some are natural, and some are groundless; and that of the
          natural some are necessary as well as natural, and some are natural
          only. And of the necessary desires, some are necessary if we are to be
          happy, and some if the body is to remain unperturbed, and some if we
          are even to live. By the clear and certain understanding of these
          things we learn to make every preference and aversion, so that the
          body may have health and the soul tranquillity, seeing that this is
          the sum and end of a blessed life. For the end of all our actions is
          to be free from pain and fear; and when once we have attained this,
          all the tempest of the soul is laid, seeing that the living creature
          has not to go to find something that is wanting, or to seek something
          else by which the good of the soul and of the body will be fulfilled.
          When we need pleasure, is, when we are grieved because of the absence
          of pleasure; but when we feel no pain, then we no longer stand in need
          of pleasure. Wherefore we call pleasure the alpha and omega of a
          blessed life. Pleasure is our first and kindred good. From it is the
          commencement of every choice and every aversion, and to it we come
          back, and make feeling the rule by which to judge of every good thing.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">And since pleasure is our first and
          native good, for that reason we do not choose every pleasure
          whatsoever, but ofttimes pass over many pleasures when a greater
          annoyance ensues from them. And ofttimes we consider pains superior to
          pleasures, and submit to the pain for a long time, when it is attended
          for us with a greater pleasure. All pleasure, therefore, because of
          its kinship with our nature, is a good, but it is not in all cases our
          choice, even as every pain is an evil, though pain is not always, and
          in every case, to be shunned. It is, however, by measuring one against
          another, and by looking at the conveniences and inconveniences, that
          all these things must be judged. Sometimes we treat the good as an
          evil, and the evil, on the contrary, as a good; and we regard
          independence of outward goods as a great good, not so as in all cases
          to use little, but so as to be contented with little, if we have not
          much, being thoroughly persuaded that they have the sweetest enjoyment
          of luxury who stand least in need of it, and that whatever is natural
          is easily procured, and only the vain and worthless hard to win. Plain
          fare gives as much pleasure as a costly diet, when once the pain due
          to want is removed; and bread and water confer the highest pleasure
          when they are brought to hungry lips. To habituate self, therefore, to
          plain and inexpensive diet gives all that is needed for health, and
          enables a man to meet the necessary requirements of life without
          shrinking, and it places us in a better frame when we approach at
          intervals a costly fare, and renders us fearless of fortune.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">When we say, then, that pleasure is
          the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal, or the
          pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood by some who are either
          ignorant and prejudiced for other views, or inclined to misinterpret
          our statements. By pleasure, we mean the absence of pain in the body
          and trouble in the soul. It is not an unbroken succession of drinking
          feasts and of revelry, not the pleasures of sexual love, not the
          enjoyment of the fish and other delicacies of a splendid table, which
          produce a pleasant life: it is sober reasoning, searching out the
          reasons for every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs
          through which greatest tumults take possession of the soul. Of all
          this, the beginning, and the greatest good, is prudence. Wherefore,
          prudence is a more precious thing even than philosophy: from it grow
          all the other virtues, for it teaches that we cannot lead a life of
          pleasure which is not also a life of prudence, honour, and justice;
          nor lead a life of prudence, honour, and justice which is not also a
          life of pleasure. For the virtues have grown into one with a pleasant
          life, and a pleasant life is inseparable from them.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Who then is superior, in thy
          judgment, to such a man? He holds a holy belief concerning the gods,
          and is altogether without fears about death; he has diligently
          considered the end fixed by nature, and has understood how easily the
          limit of good things can be satisfied and procured, and how either the
          length or the strength of evils is but slight. He has rejected fate
          which some have introduced as universal mistress, no less than chance,
          in respect of what is due to human agency, for he sees that fate
          destroys responsibility, and that fortune is inconstant; as for our
          actions, there is no lord and master over them, and it is to them that
          blame and praise naturally ensue. Better were it, indeed, to believe
          the legend of the gods, than be in bondage to the destiny taught by
          the physical philosophers; for the theological myth gives a faint hope
          of deprecating divine wrath by honouring the gods, while the fate of
          the philosophers is deaf to all supplications. Nor does he hold chance
          to be a god, as the world in general does, for in the acts of God
          there is no disorder, nor to be a cause, though an uncertain one, for
          he believes that good or evil is not given by it to men so as to make
          life blessed, though it supplies the starting-point of great good and
          great evil. He believes that the misfortune of the wise is better than
          the prosperity of the fool. It is better, in short, that what is
          well-judged in action should not owe its successful issue to the aid
          of chance.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2">Exercise thyself in these and
          kindred precepts day and night, both by thyself and with him who is
          like unto thee; and never, either in waking or in dream, wilt thou be
          disturbed, but wilt live as a god amongst men. For in nothing does he
          resemble a mortal creature, the man who lives in immortal
          blessedness.&quot;</font></p>

        <p align="justify">Thus unequivocally does Epicureanism proclaim
        pleasure to be the end of nature <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        race of man. The announcement of such a doctrine naturally gave rise to
        a chorus of reproving and protesting voices. Even if it be true that we
        are irresistibly urged towards pleasure by an impulse of our nature, it
        is our duty, say the objectors, to guard against the temptations thus
        arising. We have nobler aims to live for than mere pleasure. Honour and
        duty demand our allegiance: obligations bind us to our family and
        friends and to our country. Pleasure is of the earth, but virtue calls
        us to make ourselves worthy of heaven. A mere pleasure-seeker is of all
        beings the most miserable: his search is hopeless: and the fruits he
        plucks are but as apples of Sodom and turn into ashes between his teeth.
        The man of pleasure must inevitably, it is said, cry out, Vanity of
        vanities: all is vanity. Worse than this: his pleasures will become more
        and more sensual, degrading, and animal. As life goes on, his jaded
        sensibilities require more poignant excitements to ward off the attacks
        of ennui. A life of pleasure hardens the heart, and the sense of
        enjoyment comes to find a peculiar delight in the sight of others
        suffering. Domitian at Rome and Catherine the Second of Russia are
        pointed out as the examples warning against lawless lust for pleasures.
        That Epicureanism should inculcate a lesson which bears such fruits
        seems argument enough to condemn it.</p>
        <p align="justify">In all of this the truth is marred by exaggeration.
        There is a long interval between the statement that pleasure is the
        natural law, and the recommendation to pursue pleasures everywhere and
        above all things. The former can hardly be disputed, when explained; the
        latter is unwise and, possibly, impracticable advice. To do justice to
        the doctrine of Epicurus we should never forget that it is to a large
        extent the reaction and protest of an opposition. Its statements to be
        understood must be taken in connection with the doctrines to which they
        are antagonistic. Every thesis loses half its meaning, and almost all
        its truth, when completely dissevered from its antithesis. The
        expression of a dogma in such a case is misleading. The author, strong
        in his sense of a correction to be made, hardly gives full place to the
        large and important body of doctrine which he accepts without
        correction. His exposition is fragmentary and unbalanced, and requires
        to be interpreted with caution. Because something is passed over in
        silence, we must not infer that it is denied. Every revelation of new
        truth, every attempt at reform, always and necessarily assumes and
        tacitly embodies with itself much that was old.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicureanism need not be assumed, therefore, to
        abolish or contradict the old morality altogether, although it proposes
        to put it upon a new foundation, and denies the especial principles on
        which the virtues were sometimes said to be founded. In the moral
        systems of Plato and Aristotle a very subordinate and undignified place
        was assigned to pleasure. When Aristotle in his <i>&quot;Ethics&quot;</i>
        attempts to find the characteristic mark of virtue, he sees it in the
        circumstance that the end or aim of the action is <i>&#964;ò

        acts out of mechanical obedience into conscious actualization of an
        ethical world or moral cosmos. The presupposition here, as in Plato, is
        that of an order which exists before us, of an ideal perfection which we
        do not make, and can but approximate to. Of the origin and authority of
        this fundamental idea of his ethical system Aristotle can scarcely be
        said to render any account. What the &quot;beautiful&quot; is, and how
        it comes to sway our conduct, is rather removed from his range. Nor can
        Plato be said to carry more conviction when he asserts, what in its way
        is true enough, that these conceptions are the very ante-natal dower of
        the soul <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        with before it sank into the darkness of this sense-world in which we
        live. The interesting question still remains how we as human beings come
        to shake off the confusing influences of nature, and learn to see the
        idea of goodness in its very truth. But Plato, though he attacks this
        question, does not answer it. He discusses an analogous question, viz.,
        how the statesman is to be equipped for his duties; and to the statesman
        thus formed and perfected he entrusts the task of telling the ordinary
        human being what is to be done and what is not to be done. And a like
        criticism may be passed on Aristotle. They both had in view an objective
        order and system which stood above the likes and feelings of men; and a
        willing conformity to this order was the aim which they assigned to the
        legislator in his normative action in society. So long as there was a
        tolerable agreement between this ideal order and the actual
        constitutions under which men lived, so long their theory might be
        accepted. But when even the blindest eye could no longer refuse to see
        in the existing political forms only a tissue of vice, injustice, and
        baseness, then the ideal order, bereft of its sensuous vicegerent, the
        State, must collapse or find another support.</p>
        <p align="justify">The ancient sages before Epicurus had condemned
        pleasure, and opposed it to virtue. A few of them went so far as to
        carry out the implication, and to assert the absolute incompatibility of
        pleasure and virtue. Aristotle had not been so extravagant. In pleasure
        he recognised the sign that the capacity and tendency to good which
        habit and discipline had produced had at length become a second nature.<a HREF="#notes07"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;
        He had spoken of pleasure as the accompaniment of such action as
        combined the fullest expansion of a natural power in the agent with the
        most satisfactory condition of the objects in which it found room for
        its exercise. Pleasure was the concomitant of action when the perfect
        agent found a perfect medium for his action. But the character of the
        active power made a profound difference in the estimate to be formed of
        the pleasure. There were higher pleasures, and there were lower
        pleasures. This distinction of the worth or worthlessness of different
        pleasures rests upon the presumption that there is a hierarchical system
        of ends in life, that some acts or things are intrinsically worth more
        than others, quite apart from the pleasure which individuals may derive
        from them. It rests on a belief in ideas and on ideal truth: on the
        faith that man is only a member of a great order, an everlasting realm
        of truth and goodness, which receives him when he comes into the world,
        and which connects him with the past and the future, as well as with his
        contemporaries in the present.</p>
        <p align="justify">Such an order Epicureanism ignores. It isolates a man
        from his membership of the body politic; it cuts him off from anything
        beyond this life by the doctrine of man's absolute mortality. For
        Epicureanism man is a sentient being, capable of pleasure and pain, and
        possessed of an intelligence which enables him to take forethought for
        both. Around him are other sentient beings similarly circumstanced, with
        whom it is often necessary, and sometimes convenient, that he should
        come into contact and relationship. But these connections are lax,
        accidental, and temporary; the unions so formed are transient, and owe
        their existence and maintenance to the convenience of individuals. They
        have no subsistence in themselves, no rights as against individuals, no
        powers to enforce obligations or require duties. The individual being,
        susceptible to pains and pleasures, is the starting-point and the
        standard. Nothing exists outside him which should thwart and check the
        claims of his person to enjoyment, nothing of an ideal kind, at any
        rate. To some extent, however, the bond which is thus taken off is
        reimposed as the easier and lighter yoke of friendship.</p>
        <p align="justify">Antiquity is almost unanimous in the praises it
        bestows upon the friendly affection which prevailed in the communities
        of Epicureans.<a HREF="#notes07"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp; Friendship

        joys by fellowship. In itself, the fact of friendship bears witness to
        something beyond the mere individual, perhaps <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>but it speaks only imperfectly and
        indistinctly. Reflection seems to show that all friendship has a selfish
        basis, and is built upon utility. In every union of affection the
        cynical observer is able to point to something which may be interpreted
        into the presence of an earthly element, a self-regarding consideration.
        Nor is the cynical observer to be pronounced in error. The
        self-regarding cannot be entirely absent from anything human; the
        absolutely and wholly unselfish is the divine. But the cynical observer
        is wrong in emphasizing this fact to the exclusion of another side. The
        prophet and the reformer are not to be regarded as hypocrites because
        even in their holiest fervours and their purest counsels the absence of
        self is never perfect and undisputed. Rather were it well to note the
        different contents and structure of the self which is operative in
        different individuals. There is a wide interval between the self which
        excludes all others in antagonism and the self which includes them in
        love.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet for an ordinary world, the cynicism which reminds
        us that utility is the creator of law and morality is not altogether
        without its value. Harsh as it may sound against more ideal or more
        sentimental principles, the assertion of utilitarianism has at least the
        advantage of fighting against an unreasoning conservatism adhering to
        the past with blind tenacity. Even if utility be not an adequate formula
        to account for the existence of the organization of human society on its
        present basis, it at least affords a mark for the reformer, and suggests
        ameliorations. In the great words in which Plato proclaimed the rights
        of reason against authority and tradition,<a HREF="#notes07"><sup>5</sup></a>
        there is not and never will be finer phrase than this: only the useful
        is truly beautiful and noble, only the harmful truly unsightly and bad.</p>
        <p align="justify">But the basis of utilitarianism may be different, as
        the doctrine itself varies. It may rest on a philanthropic sentiment, a
        humanitarian feeling. Such a foundation must to Epicurus have seemed
        vague and uncertain; and he builds his creed accordingly on a more solid
        foundation; more solid, that is, if we compare sentiment with sentiment.
        He bases it on the natural feeling of pleasure, and on the general
        gravitation of all human kind towards pleasure. No more than other
        writers is Epicurus able to give a definition of pleasure. To know what
        is meant by being pleased we must go to consciousness, to feeling.
        &quot;The state of pleasure,&quot; says Professor Bain, &quot;is an
        ultimate, indefinable experience of the mind. The fact itself is known
        to each person's consciousness: the modes, varieties, degrees,
        collaterals, and effects of it, may be stated in propositions.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;
        In a sense, it is quite true that every one does understand what is
        meant by pleasure. Unfortunately, however, the word pleasure, like all
        words of this 'abstract' description, easily becomes ambiguous. It
        denotes not merely the abstract and general relation in virtue of which
        an act or object is termed pleasant, but also the particular objects or
        acts themselves which give pleasure to some, or perhaps to the majority
        of mankind. Like other abstract terms, it is interpreted and defined by
        the habits and experience of each individual. It is specified into
        various concrete pleasures, and identified with certain things which
        produce pleasure. Every man has pleasures of his own, and the cases are
        rare where the same thing gives pleasure to everybody.</p>
        <p align="justify">The phrase &quot;pursue pleasure,&quot; is therefore
        somewhat elliptical. Strictly speaking, we do not and cannot pursue
        pleasure; which is as great an abstraction as the pursuit of truth,
        perhaps even a greater; for the latter, at least, is in some degree
        objective and abiding, whereas pleasure is transient and subjective.
        What we pursue are certain objects of desire, the attainment of which
        causes pleasure. Pleasure in itself, if we may use such an expression,
        is neither one thing nor another: what it is depends entirely on the
        nature of the person, and the character of the object. No so-called
        pleasure has the power of producing pleasure, inevitably and in all
        circumstances. Yet for this reason, it may be said what we desire is not
        a thing, but rather an action. It is the eating, and not the food, which
        gives pleasure to the hungry.</p>
        <p align="justify">There is a controversy, in some respects verbal,
        raised on this point. It may be said, that the object of a desire is not
        pleasure, but some special thing or act. &quot;All particular appetites
        and passions,&quot; says Bishop Butler,<a HREF="#notes07"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>
        </sup>&quot;are towards external things themselves, distinct from the
        pleasure arising from them.&quot; Action, which should have in view no
        particular object but only the general end of pleasure, would be so
        indefinite and vague as to be unreal. The actual appetites of the actual
        human being go straight at their specific ends. It is only with
        reflection and thought that the voluptuary who pursues pleasure for
        pleasure's sake becomes in any degree possible. A mere liking for
        pleasant things does not make a voluptuary, or few would escape the
        name. To become a voluptuary, a human being must care for and desire
        nothing in these pleasant things but the pleasure which they bring to
        his individual self. Every concrete reality fades away into nothingness
        in his eyes except his own consciousness, and the honey which can be
        extracted by him from the vast world, for whose intrinsic existence and
        fortunes he has no interest whatever. To such a person, if he can be
        said anywhere to exist in full-fledged reality, the doctrine that
        pleasure is the sole object of desires may be applied.</p>
        <p align="justify">No such assertion does Epicurus, however, make. The
        end of nature, he says, is pleasure. Pleasure, and not pain, is the end
        towards which all things in the world tend as their natural and normal
        condition. But what are pleasure and pain? It is necessary to look at
        them together. No doubt it may be said that there is a third or neutral
        state, which is neither pleasure nor pain. There are certainly many
        states of consciousness, which we should not in ordinary language
        describe as either pleasant or painful. But whether that gives a ground
        for asserting that these states are absolutely without such quality, are
        wholly indifferent, is a question which seems difficult to answer in the
        affirmative. It may, however, be convenient to assume the existence of
        some such point of transition and indifference as a terminus from which
        we ordinarily measure the degree of pleasure or of pain, or as an
        average level of no very definable character, and liable to divergence
        on two sides.</p>
        <p align="justify">According to Plato, however, there are two categories
        of pleasures ordinarily so called.<a HREF="#notes07"><sup>8</sup></a>&nbsp;
        There are pleasures which rest, to some extent, upon an illusion; they
        seem pleasant, that is, when set in contrast with a background of pain.
        In themselves they are nothing positive: they are no more than the
        absence or the removal of uneasiness. They presuppose an antecedent
        pain: they are the satisfaction of a want. Of this kind, for example, is
        the pleasure derived from eating by the hungry man. These pleasures are
        unreal and untrue. On the other hand, there are pleasures <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>as an instance, Plato gives the
        pleasures of smell <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>which are preceded by no pain. They
        accompany certain exertions of activity or certain states of
        susceptibility: they come unsought, and leave no sense of want behind
        them. Such pleasures are positive and real.</p>
        <p align="justify">It may be doubted if this distinction rests on wholly
        satisfactory ground. The sense of want or desire which accompanies
        certain pleasures as their condition, is probably to be explained by
        their close connection with our nature and character, whether original
        or acquired. The pleasures of smell, to take Plato's instance, excite no
        previous desires in most cases, because they have little connection with
        our well-being; and the pleasure they do produce may, perhaps, be due
        directly or indirectly to an association with life-giving and beneficial
        function. Perhaps, too, the facility with which certain pleasures may be
        represented by imagination in the objects which habitually cause them,
        has something to do with the feeling of uneasiness which Plato alludes
        to. At any rate, all pleasures seem to be, at least in the case of those
        who feel them most acutely, attended by the sense of want. But, of
        course, there is a difference of another origin which has a bearing upon
        the point. The pleasures of the sensualist are much less within his own
        power than those of the intellectualist. The former is in a large degree
        dependent on the favour of external circumstances, and thus inevitably
        he must occasionally be deprived of a favourite gratification, must
        suffer want and pain. The intellect carries its own resources, at least,
        to a large extent, and is less dependent on external help. But even in
        the case of intellectual delights, the absence of intellectual exercise
        would be felt as a pain and loss, and a man would put himself to pain
        and trouble to recover his mental ease and freedom. The various
        conditions under which pleasure is experienced seem to point in the
        direction of the relativity of pleasure and pain. Whether as the removal
        of an obstruction, the conquest of a difficulty, the replenishment of a
        void, the satisfaction of an uneasiness, the re-establishment of an
        equilibrium, the enlargement of an imprisoned force, pleasure
        presupposes something of its opposite.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is in this sense that Epicurus defines pleasure:
        &quot;When once the pain arising from deficiency has been removed, the
        pleasure in the flesh admits of no further augmentation, but only of
        variation: and similarly the limit of the pleasure of the mind is
        reached, when the causes of our principal mental fears have been
        removed.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07"><sup>9</sup></a> The limit of pleasure,
        according to the stock phrase, was the eradication of everything
        painful. When so much has been gained, no further increase in the amount
        of the pleasure is possible. Subsequently, of course, variety may be
        introduced by more costly appliances, but the net result will be the
        same as that gained by simpler methods. And for that reason it is a wise
        precaution to find out experimentally the simplest and least expensive
        mode of gratifying our wants, not with any ascetic intention, but simply
        to prepare for a state of affairs when the more costly means is not at
        our command. If it be said that the variety and vicissitude of luxuries
        also satisfies what is to many a real want, Epicurus replies by
        instituting a distinction between our wants. Of the desires, some are
        pronounced to be natural and necessary; others to be natural, but not
        necessary; a third class includes desires which are neither natural nor
        necessary, but due merely to fancy and fashion. This division of desires
        and pleasures into the natural and the artificial comes from older
        sources: it is laid down, for example, by the Cynic. But it is in the
        application of the distinction to hedonism that the important point lies
        for Epicureanism. Epicurus, like the Stoics in his own time, and like
        Rousseau and his adherents in the last century, tries to find in nature
        a help against fashion and civilization. It is nothing to have cast away
        the rags of superstition, if we still retain the artificial vestments of
        human culture. Avoid all culture, was the advice of Epicurus.<a HREF="#notes07"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;
        He is at war with the artificialities of life. Nature had made man
        upright, but he had sought out many inventions. An exclusive literary
        training was leading men away from the perception of the truth of life,
        to spend their days in a hollow world of unreality, filled with
        æsthetic vanities, with political pomps, with religious anxieties. To
        the doctrine that poetry and art had a useful end, the Epicureans
        opposed a denial; poetry might be justified on some grounds, but
        certainly not for its utility.<a HREF="#notes07b"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;
        If the hard-worked statesman, said Epicurus in his work on Kingdom,<a HREF="#notes07b"><sup>12</sup></a>
        desires relaxation, let him seek it in the tales of war, or even in
        rough common jesting, but not in æsthetic discussions, on topics of
        music and poetry; let him seek his amusement in spectacles and pageants,
        in the drama and the concert, but not in critical or philological
        investigations of the principles of art. Epicurus is impatient of the
        nebulous regions which only exist, according to him, for highly
        sensitive and sentimental souls.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this way Epicureanism seems to approach to a point
        of view at the opposite pole of opinion, viz. Cynicism or Stoicism.
        &quot;Man needs but little here,&quot; is its assertion. &quot;Riches,
        according to nature, are of limited extent, and can easily be procured;
        but the wealth craved after by vain fancies knows neither end nor
        limit.&quot; &quot;He who has understood the limits of life, knows how
        easy to get is all that takes away the pain of want, and all that is
        required to make our life perfect at every point. In this way he has no
        need of anything which implies a contest.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07b"><sup>13</sup></a>
        Thus Epicurus can scarcely be identified with the ordinary advocates of
        pleasure. His hedonism is of a sober and reflective kind. It rests on
        the assumption that pleasure is the end or natural aim, but, it adds,
        that the business of philosophy is to show within what limits that end
        is attainable. Thus, if, on one hand, it declares against the
        philosophers that pleasure is the law of nature, and that ideal ends
        ought to promote the welfare of humanity, it declares on the other
        against the multitude that the ordinary pursuit of pleasure, and the
        common ideas of its possibilities, are erroneous. To the ordinary vision
        the search for pleasure is endless: one beckons after another:
        illimitable vistas of new delights seem to extend before the ravished
        eyes. All this is a delusion, says Epicurus. True pleasure is
        satisfaction, and not a yearning, which, though momentarily stilled,
        bursts forth again.</p>
        <p align="justify">It would almost seem a misnomer to call this
        pleasure. As true politeness, so-called, often differs widely with what
        is usually understood by politeness, so true pleasure seems far apart
        from pleasure in its vulgar meaning. A body free from pain, and a mind
        released from perturbations, is the ideal of Epicurean life. The
        prominent point, in short, is not the doctrine that pleasure is the
        natural end. That Epicurus asserts as a universal law of animated
        existence.</p>
        <p align="justify">But what he emphasizes is rather the conditions under
        which this end is possible for man. He seems, at first sight, to
        describe pleasure, as Schopenhauer, as a merely negative state, as the
        absence of pain. It would, however, be a grave mistake were we to
        suppose that because this condition is negatively described, it was a
        mere abstraction or negation. The imperturbability of the Epicurean was
        not an ascetic or an insensate withdrawal from all life and action. But
        it certainly introduced a rational and reflective aspect into the
        doctrine of hedonism, as it had been practised or taught by Aristippus
        of Cyrene. The Cyrenaic preached enjoyment of the present moment: he
        took pleasure as he found it scattered all over the earth. He did not
        balance pleasure against pleasure. His theory was, that as pleasure is
        the one thing desirable, the main aim of education should be to fit men
        to enjoy with all their heart, to give them that strength of mind and
        body, which enables them to take pleasure in anything.&nbsp; He
        said:&nbsp; Learn to enjoy at each moment the absolute good of life is
        before you, and you ought to attain it. You need not wait for the lapse
        of time, so as to see how it has turned out upon the whole. Comparison
        and reflection are the foe of pleasure. You must be able to throw
        yourself wholly into what this moment presents, as if this moment were
        eternity with no before or after. When another moment comes, you treat
        it in like manner. Thus, while you enjoy each in its turn to the full,
        you remain detached from its control, you are still your own master,
        your action creates no obligation, you are equally free to enjoy what
        comes next.</p>
        <p align="justify">To all of this the reply of the Epicurean is that
        such a doctrine, if practicable at all, is only possible under
        exceptional circumstances. To carry it out implies a previous training
        and reflection on life as a whole, on its capacities and its needs, on
        the laws of nature, and the relations of men to one another. A happy
        tact, a natural taste, may, in peculiarly gifted natures, and in
        favourable circumstances, enable a man to enjoy, without running upon
        the shoals and quicksands which beset the course of the pleasure-seeker.
        But in the vast majority of cases, where no æsthetic instincts guide
        the decision, the search for pleasure proves a chase after a phantom,
        which allures only to deceive. For &quot;the flesh takes the limits of
        pleasure to be endless, and an endless time would be needed to provide
        it; but the mind, having learned the limit and the end of the flesh, and
        having cast away fears about the distant future, has made for us life
        perfect and adequate, and we no longer need infinite time. And yet it
        has not been an exile from pleasure, and when the time comes to depart
        from life, it closes with no sense of having fallen short of
        felicity.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp; In other
        words, if we really and truly enjoy the moment, we can only do so by
        having taken, some time or other, a view beyond the moment, and having
        learned to see each moment in the light of the whole life, of our nature
        as a whole. We must refer each action to the end and aim of nature, and
        not throw ourselves blindly into what promises pleasure.</p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;No pleasure is evil in itself, but the objects
        productive of certain pleasures may lead to annoyances many times
        greater than the pleasure.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07b"><sup>15</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Hence the place of prudence or reflection in the Epicurean system, as
        the chief of the virtues. But it must not be supposed that the function
        of <i>&#966;&#961;ó&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</i> is in Epicurus
        any more than in Aristotle, merely to weigh pleasure against pleasure,
        so as to choose the heavier. Prudence, here as there, means the
        intelligent conception of human nature, as a whole, in its limits and
        its powers. It is not a fitful and casual agent, interfering with the
        natural bent towards pleasure, and exhorting it to hear reason, but a
        deep-settled and permanent character <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        preserve from extravagance and excess. If reflection, indeed, were
        employed to choose amongst pleasures with a conscious reasoning at every
        moment, such a process would certainly be a kill-joy.&nbsp; But this is
        only the case with the learner, who is endeavouring to correct his
        natural errors. As he advances in the path of perfection, the feeling of
        opposition between the habitual tendency fostered by evil influences and
        the rational law of nature grows fainter, till at last, in the character
        of the ideal sage, it disappears altogether. Once for all, the wise man
        has counted the cost, and learnt the real worth, of various enjoyments;
        he has learned to discriminate apparent from real pleasures, and can
        turn away without a single sigh of regret from many entertainments which
        the world esteems highly.</p>
        <p align="justify">This, then, is one point of contrast between
        pleasure, as understood by the Cyrenaics and Epicureans. With the former
        it was the pleasure of the moment, of action and excitement: life, as a

        With the Cyrenaic it was the pleasure of the healthy and vigorous
        natural man; with the Epicurean, of the philosopher, and, perhaps, to
        some extent, of the weakly valetudinarian. Epicureanism could thus
        appeal to the many, whilst Cyrenaic theories could only find an echo in
        specially-endowed personalities. Few in any age can stand for a portrait

        fell on the battle-field fighting for his fatherland. He limited his
        desires, not at the point fixed by Epicurus, but by his own satiety: yet
        never so as to injure his health. His exercise was arranged so as to
        make him come hungry and thirsty to dinner; his food was at once
        calculated to please the palate and promote digestion, and his wine was
        selected of such quality as to give pleasure and produce no injury. As
        for the other enjoyments which Epicurus declares to be an essential part
        of the conception of happiness, he tasted them, too. He did not suffer
        from pain; yet when it did come he bore it manfully, trusting perhaps
        more to a physician than a philosopher. He had a splendid colour, sound
        health, great popularity; in a word, his life was brimful of every
        variety of pleasure.&quot; But people with all these advantages are on
        the whole rare, and a gospel for their benefit is scarcely needed.
        Epicureanism addressed itself to a frailer and humbler multitude, who
        neither in circumstances nor in personal endowments were equal to making
        the world comport itself to their demands. It proposed to enable them,
        by discipline, to gain all that the others acquired by wealth, position,
        and innate force. It preached that pleasure was not restricted to the
        rich or to the might, but was equally attainable by the poor and the
        lowly. It levelled all ranks and equalized men, by showing that it is
        the variety and superficial glitter of pleasure and not its essence
        which imposed upon the powerful and their admirers. Epicurus thus took
        from Cynicism its representation of the difference between artificial
        and natural pleasures and desires; but he employed the distinction for
        different purposes, and with other presuppositions. He did not, like
        them, allow the means to become an end.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is sometimes put as another difference between
        Epicurus and his Cyrenaic predecessors, that while the latter put the
        bodily pleasures highest, the former gave preference to the pleasures of
        the mind. It may, of course, be said that as the mind, whether as <i>animus</i>
        or as <i>anima</i> (to adopt a Lucretian distinction<a HREF="#notes07b"><sup>18</sup></a>),
        is, according to Epicurus, only a species of body or matter, any
        distinction between the mental and bodily in such a system can be of
        little importance. This, however, would be to confuse the explanation of
        a difference with the difference itself. To the Epicureans, as to
        everybody else, the distinction between body and mind was an important
        one, however it was accounted for in terms of their especial creed. But
        the ground on which the mental is put higher than the corporeal in its
        capacity for enjoyment or misery is not based on abstruse
        considerations, but simply on the fact that while the flesh simply felt
        in the moment, and for the moment, the mind could be under the combined
        influence of past, present, and future. The flesh, <i>&#963;á&#961;&#958;</i>,
        as Epicurus terms the blind, natural, and unconscious self in us, looks
        neither before nor after; it pines for nothing, and has no prospects of
        coming joy. It is buried in itself. The mind, on the contrary, the
        intelligent self, has a larger range, both in its pleasures and its
        pains. Yet it might be urged that this consideration tells both ways:
        the mind can relieve its pain by the prospect of deliverance, and can
        damp a joy by the reflection on future or contemporaneous pains.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet it would be a foolish mistake to suppose that
        when Epicurus thus advocates the primacy for mind, he is doing more than
        asserting that the pains and pleasures of the intelligent man have an
        intensity and vigour exceeding those of the mere boor. He has no idea of
        pleasures which exclude the body from all share. On this point we have a
        sentence which his adversaries have quoted and misconstrued to their own
        delight. &quot;I am unable,&quot; he says, &quot;to form any conception
        of good, from which have been eliminated the pleasures of eating and
        drinking, the pleasures of sexual love, the pleasures of music and
        eloquence, and the pleasures of shape and pleasant movements.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07b"><sup>19</sup></a>
        Of course this does not mean that pleasure merely lies in these things.
        But it does assert that a pleasure from which they have all been
        excluded as unreal and incompatible, is to Epicurus an impossible and
        fanciful conception <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:

        is to be looked at in that light, as a protest against a school of
        ethics which regarded bodily pleasure as something unworthy and
        degrading, and held that the true and real pleasure was intellectual or
        mental. It is here that Epicurus is directing his remarks against the
        idealist philosophers, who made their heaven a life of intellectual
        vision of truth. Such a one-sided view of human nature as a mere spirit
        or reason is what Epicureanism constantly and rightly denies. But, as we
        have seen, it equally on the other hand refuses to acknowledge the
        supremacy of the mere flesh. It never flinches from the difficult task
        of emphasizing the complete constitution of human nature <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        <p align="justify">In the same way we have this double edge of
        Epicureanism presented in the statement that, &quot;It is impossible to
        live pleasantly without living wisely, and well, and justly, and it is
        impossible to live wisely and well, and justly, without living
        pleasantly.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07b"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp; The path of
        virtue and the path of pleasure coincide. &quot;It is my belief,&quot;
        says Seneca, &quot;however much my fellow-Stoics may disagree with me,
        that the teaching of Epicurus is holy and right; pleasure with him is
        reduced to something small and slender, and the very law which we impose
        on virtue he lays down for pleasure: he bids it obey nature. And,
        therefore, I shall not say, like many of the Stoics, that the sect of
        Epicurus is a guide to vice; but this I say, it has a bad name, an
        ill-repute, and that undeservedly. Its countenance gives room for such
        stories, and suggests wrong expectations. It is like a brave man dressed
        as a woman.&quot;<sup><a HREF="#notes07c">21</a></sup>&nbsp; But
        Epicurus was denied the credit, and even the right, of making this
        identification between true virtue and true happiness. Words of his were
        quoted to the effect that &quot;we should honour virtue and goodness and
        the like, if they produce pleasure, but not otherwise,&quot; or that
        &quot;he scorned virtue and its foolish admirers when it produced no
        pleasure.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07c"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp; To understand
        these statements and give them no exaggerated sense, it is well to
        recollect against whom they are directed. They are no abstract
        enunciations, but polemical remarks directed against exaggeration on the
        opposite side. And that exaggeration is found in certain forms of
        Stoical and Cynical doctrine, which make virtue an end in itself, not
        merely irrespective of the amount of pleasure it may bring to the
        individual on a special occasion, but without any consideration of its
        utility to mankind at large. These enthusiastic friends of virtue have
        confounded its accidental divergence from pleasure, in the lower sense,
        when it takes its colour from sensuality, with a divergence from
        pleasure in its higher sense, when pleasure means the blissful feeling
        of well-being. The whole character of the dispute reminds us vividly of
        Bentham's assaults upon the ascetic moralists <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        to make it a matter of merit and of duty to court pain.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07c"><sup>23</sup></a>
        Of course, Epicureanism is a great deal more than utilitarianism. It is
        a theory of life and nature as a whole, and not a mere hypothesis to
        explain the existence of moral distinctions. Epicureanism is an attempt
        to afford human souls a guide amid the perplexities of life: it is as
        much a religion as a scientific theory. Its end is practice, and not
        mere doctrine. It speaks for the benefit of the individual man as a
        being for whom life is pregnant with possibilities of pain and pleasure,
        while utilitarianism is mainly engaged with a speculative problem. Yet,
        in some ways the drift of Epicureanism would be made clear if it were
        described as an assertion of the &quot;principle of utility.&quot; When
        Bentham says that &quot;A man may be said to be a partizan of the
        principle of utility when the approbation or disapprobation he annexes
        to any action or to any measure is determined by and proportioned to the
        tendency which he conceives it to have to augment or to diminish the
        happiness of the community,&quot; he at least expresses one side of
        Epicureanism. But he does not afford equally adequate expression to the
        personal, practical, and inward aspects. The ethics of the individual,
        according to Epicurus are not merely and wholly determined by the
        interests of the community. Man has a right and a law of his own, the
        right to enjoy existence, and the duty to secure his own full and free
        development.</p>
        <p align="justify">The rights of society over the individual, the
        subordination of the individual to the laws and institutions of the
        State, are in this theory supplementary and derivative.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is in its remarks on justice and the political
        virtues that Epicureanism comes nearest to the standpoint of English
        utilitarianism. &quot;It was not because sovereignty and dominion were
        intrinsically good that men sought for fame and glory in society, but in
        order to fence themselves round from their fellowmen.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07c"><sup>24</sup></a>
        Political life is <i>apis aller</i>, or at any rate the current forms
        and institutions of political life have only a relative and subsidiary
        value. The school of political philosophy to which Epicurus Hobbes,
        Hume, and Rousseau in very different ways belong, insists upon an
        original compact between the individual members of society as the origin
        of its establishment. It is probably possible at the present day to
        acknowledge the amount of truth contained in this doctrine without
        committing one's self to its absurdities. It is no doubt true that
        society as it exists upon the face of the earth is largely due to the
        operation of natural causes, with which purpose or deliberation has
        exceedingly little to do. The necessities of procuring the means of
        subsistence, the exigencies of the sexual passion, and the natural force
        of kindred in the human race, will always and inevitably form societies
        of differing character and extent. But it is a long way from such animal
        and natural unions to the mature forms of family and civic life. The
        operations of instinct only go a small way to explain the rise of
        domesticity and political associations. The influence of the family
        instinct, if unaided, seldom goes beyond a narrow circle; and, if the
        world had to depend on that alone, the race of men would be broken up
        into an endless number of miniature societies. But other agencies step
        in to complete the work, and to resist the disintegrating tendencies of
        selfishness. On one hand tradition <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        unities. Thus even children's children bow to the supremacy of the
        family chief. And on another hand the necessities of self-defence and
        the pressure of war check the separatist forces of individualism.</p>
        <p align="justify">In what sense, then, it may be asked, are the family
        and the State due to a contract? Their comparative indissolubility seems
        to put a great separation between them and other contracts. They are
        not, as Kant in one instance supposed,<a HREF="#notes07c"><sup>25</sup></a>
        mere partial contracts for a special purpose and a special function.
        Their will and tendency are to claim the whole human being, to demand an
        undivided and a perpetual allegiance. It is against such a sweeping
        universal claim that the theory of contract has a certain relative
        justification. It is thereby declared that the rights of the individual,
        though for the time they may be put in. abeyance, are not wholly
        annihilated. The rights of the individual are in a sense paramount over
        those of the community. Such, at least, is the assertion of
        Epicureanism, and such seems to be the direction in which, even in many
        modern communistic schemes, the thought of the world is moving. The old
        Greek theory of an omnipotent State and the Catholic dogma of
        indissoluble wedlock are set aside. In their stead modern legislation
        tends more and more to emancipate the members of the family from the
        bonds of <i>status;</i> and modern politics tend more and more to found
        Government on a constitutional compact between the rulers and the
        subjects. Here as in many other places Epicurus is practical, realistic,
        and modern.</p>
        <p align="justify">Undoubtedly, neither side of the relationship can be
        ignored. To sacrifice the interests of the individual bars the way to
        reform. To put these interests forward in a one-sided way is to banish
        the very possibility of order and permanence. And, unquestionably,
        Epicurus was in harmony with the general feeling and opinion of his
        time. Man the individual, is the only <i>real</i> unit of social life:
        all other unities are so far <i>ideal</i> and fictitious, and are due to
        the combined effort of individual wills. They are entered upon with
        certain presuppositions; should they continue, when these
        presuppositions are no longer fulfilled? At any rate, when the State and
        the family cease to be mere natural unions, due solely to the instincts
        of sex and of self-defence, steadied and perpetuated by the influence of
        imitation and authority, there must be some sort of understanding or
        compact, tacit or formal, in the shape of a common law or customary
        right, accepted by the members of a community as binding upon them all.
        Not that such a compact is an arbitrary act, depending entirely on the
        will either of the majority or of a natural aristocracy. The customary
        law is an attempt to give expression to the principles which are
        required in order to make human society possible; to state, so far as
        individual bias or prejudice on the part of the expositors will allow,
        the conditions and relations which must be maintained if a society is to
        flourish and its several members reap the full advantage of its
        constitution. Such is the profession made by law; unfortunately, law, in
        its actual shape, represents seldom the relations of the community
        regarded as an organic whole, but more frequently the relations imposed
        upon a community from the point of view afforded by the privileged
        position of some one class or caste of men in the body politic.</p>
        <p align="justify">The point especially emphasized by Epicurus is, that
        law was made for man, and not man for law. Law has no intrinsic or
        abstract claim on the obedience of men except in so far as its precepts
        and its sanctions have the welfare of humanity for their aim. It is not,
        in short, because it has been legislatively declared and enacted that a
        law has obligatory force, but because it is right and expedient.
        Epicurus is at one with Hume, who says that, &quot;Public utility is the
        sole origin of justice, and reflections on the beneficial consequences
        of this virtue are the sole foundation of its merit.<a HREF="#notes07c"><sup>26</sup></a>&quot;
        &quot;Natural justice,&quot; says the former,<a HREF="#notes07c"><sup>27</sup></a>
        &quot;is a contract of expediency, so as to prevent one man doing harm
        to another. Those animals which were incapable of forming an agreement
        to the end that they neither might injure nor be injured are without
        either justice or injustice. Similarly, those tribes which could not or
        would not form a covenant to the same end are in a like predicament.
        There is no such thing as an intrinsic or abstract justice.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">So far there is not, perhaps, much practical
        objection to be taken to the theory. The case seems different when we
        hear that, &quot;Injustice is not in itself a bad thing: but only in the
        fear arising from anxiety on the part of the wrong-doer that he will not
        always escape punishment.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07c"><sup>28</sup></a>
        This anxiety, according to Epicurus, inasmuch as it never can be
        annihilated, but always lingers on in an evil conscience, is a
        sufficient deterrent from criminal actions. If we interpret this
        doctrine, after the example of some of the ancients, to mean that any
        wrong-doing would be innocent and good, supposing it escaped detection,
        we shall probably be misconstruing Epicurus. What he seems to allude to
        is rather the case of strictly legal enactments, where previously to law
        the action need not have been particularly moral or immoral: where, in
        fact, the common agreement has established a rule which is not
        completely in harmony with &quot;the justice of nature.&quot; In short,
        Epicurus is protesting against the conception of injustice which makes
        it consist in disobedience to political and social rules, imposed and
        enforced by public and authoritative sanctions. He is protesting, in
        other words, against the claim of the State upon the citizens for their
        complete obedience; against the old ideas of the divine sanctity and
        majesty of law as law; against theories like that maintained by
        contemporaries of Socrates, that there could be no such thing as an
        unjust law.<a HREF="/l%201"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">The Epicurean accepts the existence of an orderly
        society as a condition of a satisfactory life, but he does not admit
        that it has a right to demand his services. &quot;When safety on the
        side of man has been tolerably secured, it is by quiet and by
        withdrawing from the multitude that the most complete tranquillity is to
        be found.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;A wise man will not enter upon political
        life unless something extraordinary should occur.&quot; &quot;The free
        man,&quot; says Metrodôrus, &quot;will laugh his free laugh over those
        who are fain to be reckoned in the list with Lycurgus and Solon.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07c"><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp;
        A man ought not to make it his aim to save his country, or to win a
        crown from them for his abilities. Political life, which in all ages has
        been impossible for those who had not wealth, and who were unwilling to
        mix themselves with vile and impure associates, was not to the mind of
        Epicurus. If he be condemned for this, there are many nobler and deeper
        natures in the records of humanity who must be condemned on the same
        account. But it is hard to see why he should be charged with that as a
        fault which is the common practice of mankind, and which in a period of
        despotism, of absolute monarchy, is the course of obvious wisdom. And,
        above all, it is not the duty of a philosopher to become a political
        partisan, and spend his life in the atmosphere of avaricious and
        malignant passions.</p>
        <p align="justify">For politics, Epicurus substituted friendship.
        &quot;Of all the things which wisdom procures for the happiness of life
        as a whole, by far the greatest is the acquisition of friendship.&quot;<a HREF="#notes07d"><sup>31</sup></a>
        We have already spoken of the friendship of the Epicureans: a
        characteristic which did not disappear down to the latest times of the
        sect. But here, too, Epicurus is true to his realistic and non-mystical
        creed. Friendship is based upon utility mutually enjoyed: only some one
        must begin the career of service-rendering, just as we must sow the
        ground in hopes of a future harvest. Or, as Professor Bain puts it<sup><a HREF="#notes07d">32</a></sup>:
        &quot;The giver should not expect compensation, and should,
        nevertheless, obtain it.&quot; The same realistic tone is apparent in
        Epicurus's views on sexual love: where he rejects altogether what in
        modern times has received the somewhat misleading conventional name of
        Platonic love.<sup><a HREF="#notes07d">33</a></sup> Love, as he remarks,
        and as Cicero approves, is in the strict sense of the term, not
        accidentally, but essentially different from affection or friendship.
        The former is a passion or instinct. The latter is a rational and
        reflective relation of one human being to another. It is in friendship,
        freely formed and imposing no inalienable obligation, no binding
        impersonal law, that man, according to Epicurus, finds his true home.
        The only duties which he recognises are those voluntarily accepted on
        reasonable grounds, and not from natural instincts or through the
        compulsion of circumstances. The family and the State impose permanent
        checks and obligations which to him seemed to diminish the independence
        of man, and to make him a slave of external powers. Thus, the principle
        of community, rejected in its more stable forms, is accepted in its
        laxest and most flexible shape, where it is maintained solely by
        participation in pleasures in common. To leave it to such attraction
        alone seems to expose the communion of man and man too much to chance:
        it seems to provide too weak a safeguard against the inconstancy and
        inequality so characteristic of most human feelings. Yet, on the other
        hand, to maintain an association when it is only a form or bond, and not
        the genuine birth of a free spirit, seems to be dangerous and immoral.
        And perhaps Epicurus is right in holding that the best security of
        permanence in attachment is given not by imposing a yoke on unwilling or
        at least varying tempers, but by so unifying all the nature of man that
        his choices and appetencies will not change from day to day, but
        maintain a uniform tenor through all varieties of circumstance.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the ethics of the post-Aristotelian schools the
        sage or wise man plays a prominent part. In his full perfection he is
        the property of the Stoics, and represents their ideal of what the
        perfect man ought to be. The Epicureans, however, seem to have followed
        their example and drawn up an ideal picture, in which the main features
        exhibit an intentional contrast to the demands of the opposite sect. The
        wise man, they said, cannot arise in any race whatever, and must possess
        a well-ordered constitution, for virtue is not enough without certain
        natural endowments. Once he has attained that rank, he never loses it:
        once wise, he is wise for ever. But there are various degrees of wisdom,
        and not one hard-and-fast line of distinction between wise and unwise.
        The sage is not inaccessible to feelings: he will feel pain, and will
        cherish compassion. But though pain affects him, it will not deprive him
        of his happiness: he will moan when put to torture, but still retain his
        superiority to fate and circumstance. When his dependents misbehave, he
        will chastise, yet not as if without pity. All sins are not in his eyes
        of like magnitude: there are degrees in vice, as in virtue. He will not
        be over-anxious to figure in the public eye, even in his own special
        department as a philosophic teacher. Though he set up a school, he will
        not care to draw crowds of pupils: it will only be by constraint that he
        will read in public, and he will rather leave what he has to teach, in
        his writings, than try to proclaim it in places of general resort. He
        will not be indifferent to secure for himself a capital for his
        subsistence, but will keep aloof from commerce, except when in poverty
        he may be able to earn something by his teaching. The wise man will
        never fall in love with women, for such love is not heaven-sent. He will
        neither take a wife nor become the father of a family, except in very
        special circumstances; nor will he take part in the business of the
        State, nor seek for fame, except to avoid contempt.</p>

        <p align="justify">We may conclude the remarks on the Ethics of Epicurus
        by quoting a few of his sayings, mainly taken from Seneca:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">&quot;If you live by nature, you will never be
          poor: if by opinion, you will never be rich.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;Cheerful poverty is an honourable thing.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;Great wealth is but poverty when matched with
          the law of nature.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;I said this not to many persons, but only to
          you: we are a large-enough theatre, one for the other.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;You must be a bondman to philosophy, if you
          wish to gain true freedom.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">&quot;If any one thinks his own not to be most
          ample, he may become lord of the whole world, and will yet be
          wretched.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;We ought to select some good man and keep him
          ever before our eyes, so that we may, as it were, live under his eye,
          and do everything in his sight.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;It is an evil to live in necessity, but there
          is no necessity to live in necessity.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;Among the other ills which attend folly is
          this: it is always <i>beginning</i> to live.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;He enjoys wealth most who needs it least.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;A foolish life is restless and disagreeable:
          it is wholly engrossed with the future.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;With many the acquisition of riches is not an
          end to their miseries, but only a change.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;We ought to look round for people to eat and
          drink with, before we look for something to eat and drink: to feed
          without a friend is the life of a lion and a wolf.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;Trust me, your words will sound grander in a
          common bed and a rough coverlet: they will not be merely spoken then,
          they will be proved true.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;Some people leave life as if they had just
          entered it.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;It is troublesome to be always commencing
          life.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;It is absurd to run to death from weariness
          of life, when your style of life has forced you to run to death. What
          so absurd as to court death, when you have made your life restless
          through fear of death?</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;Do everything as if Epicurus had his eye upon
          you. Retire into yourself chiefly at that time when you are compelled
          to be in a crowd.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;Learn betimes to die, or if it like thee
          better, to pass over to the gods.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;The knowledge of sin is the beginning of
          salvation.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;I never wished to please the people: for what
          I know, the people does not approve; and what the people approves,
          that I know not.<a HREF="#notes07d"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;We are born once: twice we cannot be born,
          and for everlasting we must be non-existent. But thou, who art not
          master of the morrow, puttest off the right time. Procrastination is
          the ruin of life for all; and, therefore, each of us is hurried and
          unprepared at death.</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;If thou wilt make a man happy, add not unto
          his riches, but take away from his desires.<a HREF="#notes07d"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

        vigorous thinkers who lived anterior to, or outside of, the influence of
        Socrates. Democritus was, indeed, a contemporary of Socrates, but his
        work and character placed him quite on a different level from the
        Athenian philosopher. Like most of the earlier philosophers, his primary
        interest was the physical universe. He was a traveller and a man of
        science, who stood aloof from political life; while Socrates was as true
        to Athens as Dr. Johnson was to Fleet Street, and cared for no science
        which had not some bearing on human life.</p>
        <p align="justify">The main achievement with which the name of
        Democritus is connected is the atomic theory. The theory and its
        consequences were afterwards introduced in a popular form into Athens by
        Protagoras; and the somewhat sceptical applications of it by which that
        professor made himself notorious were hardly likely to secure favour to
        the parent doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">There is apparently no reference to it in the
        authentic writings of Plato. The physical writings of Aristotle,
        however, are full of criticism and comment on the Democritean theory, to
        which the Stagyrite is in the main antagonistic. The two thinkers belong
        to radically different schools. The Athenian idealist school dealt, as
        it is often scoffingly said, with words and thoughts; the Abderite with
        things. The former tried to analyze the laws of mind; the latter to
        explain the origin and constitution of the physical world, the world of
        external realities. Even when Aristotle does deal with physics, he
        reduces reality to its logical conception, and not to its mechanical
        constituents.</p>
        <p align="justify">The scientific principles of Aristotle were in
        spirit, if not in form, in contrast with those of modern science. In him
        the physical view of causality was subordinated to the logical
        conception of reason and consequence. The cause, according to Aristotle,
        was the reason why, not the antecedent. His doctrine of the four
        elements, long predominant in the scientific world, started with a rough
        popular distinction as the basis of a physical system. In his theory of
        motion he failed to separate the cause of motion from the body which is
        moved; and he believed that the body moved must be in mediate or
        immediate contact with the body moving. He introduced æsthetic
        considerations into his physical speculations, and inferred that as
        circular motion is the most perfect and simple, it must be the original
        movement of the universe. In one word, Aristotle was a teleologist. He
        held to a unity or plan in nature which determines the relations of the
        parts of the universe one to another. Thought, that is, a thinker, a
        reason, a productive mind, was the fundamental and primary fact.
        Intelligence or unification presided in the world; isolation or
        individualization of parts was only due to an act of abstraction, which,
        while it distinguishes, never absolutely and entirely separates.</p>
        <p align="justify">According to the opposite or mechanical and
        materialist theory of the universe, thought is a subjective phenomenon
        of the human brain, and has no universal connection or significance in
        the universe of things. As of only human interest, it ought to be
        ignored in an attempt to understand how things came to be what they are.
        The idea of a plan, or design of an antecedent idea, must be treated as
        a piece of anthropomorphism, and abandoned. Such is the tendency of the
        philosophy of Democritus; with whom there came to the front for the
        first time a conception which, after much rejection and long neglect,
        comes to the front again at the present day. The earlier philosophers,
        Thales ( 600 B.C.), and his successors, had attempted to explain the
        variety which at present is found on the earth by supposing it to be the
        last in the series of metamorphoses of some one primitive body. Their
        idea of this original matter was concrete and sensuous. They had at
        first no conception of matter as something inert and inanimate, but
        believed it to be endued with the spirit or personality which they felt
        in themselves; and even when they got rid of this vitality or animism,
        they supposed that the primeval matter had qualitative differences
        inherent and inseparable. It was air, or earth, or water; and the result
        of this form of investigation was to assume the existence of these
        various modes of matter from the very first, and to argue that they
        underwent new phases in the course of time. They were in the line which
        would have tended in the course of long and tedious investigations
        towards a doctrine of the chemical elements; but it need scarcely be
        said that ages would have elapsed before experiments and analysis, the
        balance and the blowpipe, could have led to such a result. The current
        of philosophic thought flowed too rapidly to allow such experimental
        delays. Speculation leapt forth to anticipate research. The atomic
        school of Leucippus and Democritus ( 430 B.C.) advanced a step in the
        solution of the question, by suggesting a new conception of matter or
        body, which threw off all the old attributes as secondary or occasional,
        and went down to primal attributes constituting the nature of body as
        such. The distinction between the attributes <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        and believed to constitute the abstract and eternal essence of matter,
        and the other attributes, called secondary, and considered to flow from
        the relations between the primary qualities of body, on the one hand,
        and the human organism, on the other <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:

        in itself, as it exists abstracted from any sentient and percipient
        beings, has only what may be called mathematical qualities. Body is what
        fills space: is the &quot;full.&quot; Apart from it, or wherever there
        is no such fulness, there is emptiness. The full and the empty: space
        filled with something, and empty of something: such are the two
        principles. But if we ask what that &quot;something&quot; is which fills
        space, it is not easy for us to guess what answer the Democriteans would
        have been able to give to this question, which never seems to have
        occurred to them. Mere extension is hardly enough to distinguish matter
        from the void, although the school of Descartes in more modern times did
        put forward extension as the fundamental and distinguishing attribute of
        corporeal substance, and accordingly denied all vacuum. But the ancient
        atomists made the existence of a void, of absolute emptiness, as
        essential a part of their system as the existence of the
        &quot;full,&quot; <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        <p align="justify">The three qualities which are usually said to
        distinguish atom from atom are shape, order, and position.<a HREF="#notes08"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>&nbsp;
        </sup>To these should, perhaps, be added differences in size and weight.
        The last-mentioned, indeed, is a disputable point. There are passages
        from which it seems that Democritus regarded weight as not an attribute
        of the atoms, but only of the aggregations which they compose.<a HREF="#notes08"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;
        But probably these statements are to be taken in a different sense. They
        may mean that the atom in all cases, however it may vary in size (and
        such variations are incalculably great), never reaches a size which can
        be seen by the bodily eye, and, therefore, inasmuch as the weight varies
        directly with the size in the case of atoms, the atom is never
        ponderable except when it combines with other atoms to form a body.</p>
        <p align="justify">The atom, then, is invisible; it never directly comes
        within the range of our perception. Its differences of size, shape, and
        position never emerge into the region commanded by the senses. The atom
        is an intellectual, not a mathematical point. It has magnitude: it is
        not mere position. But we cannot break it up really into smaller
        portions (hence its name). It is an utmost limit of disintegration, a
        sort of absolute diamond, so hard that it is impossible ever to find any
        cleavage in it. Solidity, impenetrability, invincible resistance to any
        pressure, impact, or incision, seem to be the essential and primary
        character of the atom. The atom being indivisible, is also
        indestructible. All that can ever happen to the atom is either to be
        brought into conjunction with other atoms <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        of atoms after another will fall into pieces; fabric after fabric in the
        visible world, from the vegetables and animals around us, up to the
        terrestrial mass itself, and the sun and stars, and inward and unseen

        <p align="justify">Such was in its larger outlines the theory of the
        universe which Epicurus adopted from Democritus, and developed for his
        own ends. An endless expanse and immeasurable depth of space, an abyss
        in which there are no bounds, no bottom, no end; and in the vast reaches
        of this waste of space, an infinitely numerous host of solid,
        imperishable molecules, too small singly to meet the edge of human
        vision, ever in motion, and by means of that motion entering upon
        combinations more or less lasting, but in no instance everlasting <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>such is the universe which presented
        itself to the intelligence of an Epicurean.</p>
        <p align="justify">There are one or two points on which Epicurus is said
        to have differed from Democritus. One is apparently to be found in the
        primal movement of the atoms. Democritus assumed that when once these
        atoms were put in motion, they would form vortices and revolve. He
        arrived at this conclusion, it seems, by the consideration that the
        heavier atom would overtake the higher, and then, perhaps, was decided
        by dynamical considerations to assume the rise of circular movements.
        But at any rate Epicurus, as we have seen, professed to keep more
        exactly to the facts of common experience by rejecting all circular
        motion, and generalizing the data afforded by the fall of unsupported
        bodies; whilst as an auxiliary principle, he had recourse to that
        spontaneous swerving which he believed to be a fact of common experience
        in the case of our own selves. In another point, Epicurus, as
        represented by Lucretius, seems to go further than Democritus. The atoms
        or molecules, though not susceptible of physical separation or
        discerption, are still composed of parts which can at least be
        distinguished from each other. The atom is logically divisible; for as
        it differs in the shape of each example, it must consist of not less
        than three parts <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>parts, however, which are only mathematically
        distinguishable by their different position or order in the total which
        they constitute.<sup><a HREF="#notes08">3</a></sup>&nbsp; Between such ideal
        constituents of the atom there is no intervening void. They are
        completely in contact with one another, and no force can ever succeed in
        wrenching them apart. And thus, for all the purposes of mechanical
        cosmogony, the complex molecules, formed by the union of these simple
        parts, may be treated as themselves simple and elementary.</p>
        <p align="justify">The scientific principles or axioms of Democritus
        were also adopted by Epicurus.<a HREF="/l%202"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </sup>The maxim <i>ex nihilo nihil fit</i> (out of nothing nothing can
        come) stands foremost. Creation and annihilation are equally and for the
        same reasons impossible. All alteration and change is only combination
        or severance of parts. There must be as much in the cause as in the
        effect, the antecedents must contain all that is found in the
        consequent. On this principle, be it observed, the material cause is
        all-important. The eternity and indestructibility of matter is the point
        solely emphasized. The formal cause is comparatively slighted. For if we
        look at the matter from another point of view, and consider not the
        constituents, but the order or plan into which they enter, we may rather
        say that at every moment and with every change, we have an instance of
        creation and of annihilation. Every step in organization, every stage of
        growth, shows something new brought into existence where previously
        there was nothing. The life in the rose, for instance, can be traced
        back to nothing in the chemical elements out of which it is elaborated
        in the workshop of nature. The world on its ideal side is continual
        emergence from nothing, and disappearance into nothing. It is on its
        material aspects only that the dictum of the atomists is fairly and
        fully applicable. The dictum in other words expresses an abstraction of
        truth. Its value lies in its accentuation of the principle of causality
        as the foundation of all scientific truth. Its limitation lies in the
        neglect of the law, that in every effect there is a something which was
        not in the cause; something in the conclusion which was not in the
        premises; otherwise progress, change, growth are impossible.</p>
        <p align="justify">A second principle, not very different in meaning, is
        that nothing occurs by chance, but all by reason and necessity. That is
        to say, the reign of law is absolute; all interference with the regular
        chain of causation is excluded. A third principle is more specially
        confined to the Atomic school. If motion is to be possible, so it is
        declared, there must be a void; if the universe were literally full,
        there would be a complete block, and all would be stationary. Change, in
        short, means locomotion or displacement of the particles of matter. And,
        fourthly, everything existent is nothing but atoms in space. Everything
        else supposed to exist is but fancy or opinion <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        <p align="justify">The atomic theory has had many hard things said of
        it. It has been styled a conception which destroys the beauty and
        grandeur of the universe, which substitutes mere chances for a cosmical
        plan, and mechanism for organic life; and, in the face of Lord Bacon's
        protest,<a HREF="#notes08"><sup>5</sup></a> that that school which is
        most accused of atheism doth most demonstrate religion, atomism has been
        assumed to find its inevitable issue in atheism. These charges, though
        far from groundless, are largely due to a misunderstanding; they express
        what is largely a grievance of the sentiments and the higher emotions,
        and underestimate the necessities of scientific explanation. All science
        in its abstract processes of investigation must take up a position at
        times antagonistic to the poetic and religious tendencies of our nature.
        The analyst must break up the unity into its ingredients, split the
        whole into its fractions. The first condition of the possibility of
        perfect knowledge is to be for the time content to accept imperfect and
        piecemeal acquaintance in special spheres. Before we can have science,
        we must allow the several sciences to enclose themselves in the limited
        range of their own departments. The whole must be for the time put
        aside; the general meaning or drift of existence must be ignored. In
        other words, the sciences know nothing of ideals; they are without God,
        because He is neither a part nor to be found in any part, but is all and
        in all. The man of science, as it were, steps into the place of God. He
        takes the shapeless matter of the world, and by the might of his
        intelligence creates its various forms <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        <p align="justify">Atomism carries beyond the range of direct
        observation a condition of things which is suggested by many phenomena
        within that range. It holds that the apparent continuity of the smallest
        piece of matter visible to the naked eye, or to the eye armed with
        optical instruments, is not real. The apparent continuity is a real
        discreteness; what seemed one uninterrupted total is declared to be an
        aggregation of minute particles, no two of which are absolutely in
        contact. Numerous phenomena point in this direction. Every child is
        familiar with the illusion by which the blazing torch swung rapidly
        round produces a continuous ring of fire. The knife penetrates between
        the particles of the apple. What appears a level plain to the naked eye
        becomes under the microscope a succession of hills and valleys. The
        telescope sometimes resolves the nebula into a number of single stars.
        The phenomena of light and heat, as well as some chemical
        transformations, tend to suggest the Atomic hypothesis as the simplest
        assumption for their explanation.<a HREF="#notes08"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;
        In one word, the atomic theory is in complete accordance with the same
        characteristic of our intellect which finds its clearest expression in
        number. The atomist regards every existing real substance as a sum,
        collective or aggregate of a certain number of units. The differences in
        the quantity, value, purpose, &amp;c., of these aggregates are reduced
        in this way to mere quantitative differences in the number, arrangement,
        or combination of these units in a given extent of space. The contrast
        between a solid and a fluid, or a gas, would be explained in this manner
        to be a merely gradual distinction.</p>
        <p align="justify">There are, however, two points to be noticed when we
        compare the atomic theory of Epicurus with that of modern times. In the
        first place, the ancient atomism was mainly a hypothesis, invented to
        afford a simple explanation of phenomena. It rested, so far as we know,
        on slight experimental basis. Modern atomism, on the contrary, is
        supported by a large amount of experimental evidence; it is a conclusion
        forced upon us by exact weighing and measurement. But a second
        difference is even more striking. When we ask for the character of the
        primeval units, the ancient and modern theories part company. Epicurus
        gives us a picturesque scene in his atomic hosts. Applying his mental
        telescope, we see accumulations of small bodies, of every variety of
        shape, catching hold of each other's hooks and corners, or rebounding
        from their rounded sides. Geometrical solids touching each other in
        their course and forming geometrical aggregations, this is the kind of
        atomism in vogue with Epicurus. Newton, in the close of his Optics,
        suggests a somewhat similar conception of the world. It seemed probable
        to him that &quot;God in the beginning formed matter in solid, massy,
        hard, impenetrable particles, . . . of several sizes and figures, and
        several proportions to space, and perhaps of different densities and
        forces.&quot;<a HREF="#notes08"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp; But in Newton's
        idea, we see a new property of the atoms emphasized, that of force. The
        atom has not merely geometrical aspects; it is treated as dynamical
        also. In the modern theories of molecules and vortex-rings we have an
        advance in the equipment of the ultimate elements. No longer do they,
        almost devoid of properties themselves, generate the complex variety of
        properties in the actual world. The modern molecule is a highly-organised
        body; it possesses in miniature the powers of spontaneity and movement
        which are operative in the larger macrocosm, it is perpetually
        vibrating, with an endless capacity of changing its form. No longer a
        hard, dead thing, it may be almost described as instinct with life. It
        is, moreover, subjected to measurement. Instead of mere generalities
        about the infinitesimal size of atoms, we find the speculative physicist
        examining the thickness of a soap bubble, with a view to determine the
        mass of a gaseous molecule, telling us, approximately, that two million
        molecules of hydrogen in a row would extend for a millimètre (less than
        1/53 of an inch), and even fixing the rate at which such a particle
        vibrates. Considerations like these would not have been to the mind of
        Epicurus: they would have savoured of useless curiosity. And even apart
        from this, it may be said that whatever be their justification and their
        use for mechanical and chemical science, or even, as in the cellular
        hypothesis, for physiology, they do not, for philosophical importance,
        rank on a level with the somewhat crude doctrines of Democritus. As
        suggesting a more organic view of the constitution of nature than the
        old atomists held, they deserve all recognition. But the praise bestowed
        upon the old doctrine for the simplicity of its elements cannot be
        assigned to them.</p>
        <p align="justify">The real advance of modern atomism, as seen in the
        speculations of Kant or of Boscovich, is in the substitution of forces
        for hard points. Matter is looked upon as constituted by centres of
        forces, in a complex set of relations, dependent one upon another, and
        yet resisting each other's influence. The appearance of extension and
        solidity is pronounced to rest upon the reciprocal attractions and
        repulsions of these active centres. But, after all, when forces have
        been substituted for extended atoms, the ultimate difficulty still
        remains. Why are these forces so located, and these atoms so arranged in
        the world? And the only possible answer to this question, other than a
        re-assertion that such is the given fact, is to refer to an underlying
        power which divides its energies in these diverse seats of force, and
        creates the show of a series of molecules in reciprocal relations
        throughout the universe.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was something like this that was the drift of the
        Monadology of Leibnitz. The pond, he says, which looks a mere mass of
        water, is really teeming with myriads of live fish; every portion of
        matter is like a garden luxuriant in vegetation. If we could only see
        deep enough we should see endless life, and life within life, throughout
        the universe. The ultimate realities of the world are monads. These are
        not mere dead matter, but endowed with vital forces, even with the
        beginnings of consciousness. Every monad is complete in itself, and lets
        nothing enter from without; it has a principle in itself which controls
        the series of its changes. There is within it, as it were, a spring,
        which has been wound up in the beginning, and now goes on unwinding
        itself in an endless chain of phenomena, without interruption from
        forces external. But although not in any way dependent upon each other,
        the monads are essentially parts of a great plan or pre-established
        harmony. Each of them is a meeting-point to which converge relations
        from every point in the universe; not merely is it a self-contained unit
        and law of its own movement, but also from its own special point of
        view, a mirror, in which the whole universe is ideally contained,
        reflected as in a picture. Each monad is thus in a way the whole world.<a HREF="#notes08"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">Thus in the Monadology of Leibnitz we find an
        attempt, based upon the conception of a divine plan, to combine the
        fullest recognition of the individuality of the elements in the universe
        with that peculiar universality which they possess as so many little
        worlds, whose limitation consists, not in the extent of their contents,
        but in the comparative disorder and displacement of their reflective or
        appreciative power due to what we may term the parallax of their
        position. Such a theory is the very opposite of that of Epicurus.
        According to him there was no creator who planned the order of the
        primary elements, and overruled from the beginning their whole
        subsequent career. The connections of one atom with another are wholly
        external: impact and mechanical adhesion connect bodies which have no
        congenital affinities one to another. The monads are immaterial: and
        materiality is only an appearance due to the conditions of human nature.
        The atoms, on the other hand, are essentially material: they are not
        indeed visible, but the essential qualities of visible matter are what
        they would exhibit if we could see them. All the difference between them
        lies in their variety of size, weight, and shape: a variety, however,
        which though incalculable, is not infinite.</p>
        <p align="justify">With these simple elements Epicurus proceeded to give
        an account of the various provinces of nature. It would be tedious to
        follow him in detail into these explanations. And it is also to a large
        extent unnecessary, from the circumstances of the case. For the physical
        system of Epicurus falls into two parts. There is, first, a general or
        metaphysical part, containing the principles and fundamental articles.
        The general terms of his doctrine are dogmatic: they are matters of
        principle, and not mere statements of observation. Some of these have
        already been referred to, such as the indestructibility of matter, the
        absence of chance or of teleology from a scientific explanation of the
        universe. Another, and it is one which is maintained by the Stoics no
        less manifestly than by the Epicureans, is that existence <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>by which is
        to be understood activity and passivity, the capacity of acting or being
        acted upon <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>is body, of corporeal nature. The incorporeal and the
        nonexistent are only two names for the same thing. Spirit, mind, or
        soul, if they are supposed to mean anything immaterial, are rejected
        from the world as understood by the Epicureans. All that happens is only
        transference of matter from one place to another.</p>
        <p align="justify">In its attempt to carry out these principles
        Epicureanism naturally found great difficulties <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>difficulties increased
        by the imperfect state of many of the sciences at the time. Its theory
        of perception, though not without elements of truth, was lamentably
        marred from the want of any knowledge of the mechanism of vision, the
        laws regulating the dispersion of light, and the structure of the
        nervous tissues by which the impression from a luminous body is conveyed
        to the brain. But these investigations, although they might have altered
        for the better the details of the explanation, could never have got over
        its original defects, as an attempt to render plain the genesis of life,
        sensation, and thought.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of course, it is easy on this point to do injustice
        to Epicurus. No theory whatever can explain the relation between what
        are looked upon as two distinct species of substances or phenomena,
        between one thing called mind and another called matter. We can, indeed,
        employ a number of phrases to convey some views on this question. We can
        say that mind and matter are the same substratum exhibiting different
        phenomena: that sensation is another aspect of the same fact which in
        one aspect is called motion: that thought is a function of organized
        matter, and so on. But, after all, such verbal tricks throw little real
        light upon the question. Epicurus is so far on safer ground when he
        asserts that whatever acts or suffers action has one general
        characteristic, viz., that it is bodily. But he fails to give due
        importance to the point implied in this affirmation. His own language,
        even, would lead us to the doctrine that the essential characteristic of
        body is the exhibition of energy. Force, be it only of impact or of
        resistance, is evidently the generic and primary quality of what we
        describe as body <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>as the atom. As for the geometrical qualities (shape,
        extension, position) on which the atomic theory of Epicurus lays most
        weight, they are only of secondary importance as indices or visible
        representatives of the degree and amount and relation of the primary
        factor of force. This point, though not ignored in the atomic theory of
        the ancients, is not fully taken into account, or submitted to analysis.
        Nor is this peculiar to Epicurus. Plato similarly emphasizes
        &quot;form&quot; in his ideal theory. Geometry, not dynamical physics,
        is his model. They fail to note that force, function, or energy is the
        real significance of what by the senses of sight and touch is construed
        as extension. As that only exists which is active, the real meaning of
        existence is, as Aristotle said, activity (<i>&#949;&#957;&#941;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;</i>).&nbsp;
        Body makes its presence manifest by its activity. Hence, although we may
        accept the dictum of Epicurus that all activity is connected with a
        corporeal substratum, or is sensibly manifested (<i>i.e.</i> to the eye)
        as extension and figure, still it is wrong to attribute all importance
        to the second aspect, and deny it to the first. And this is precisely
        what Epicureanism does.</p>
        <p align="justify">And when Epicurus teaches the corporeality of. mind
        and soul, he falls into similar errors. He cannot recognise existence
        under any other shape save that of extended matter. Mind, therefore, and
        soul, which he, like the multitude, believes to exist, are reduced by
        him to the level of extended and material substance. They are made, it
        is true, of peculiar and more delicate particles, a mixture of special
        elements, as Epicurus holds, following a line of argument which seems
        more kindred to the speculations of Empedocles than of Democritus. In
        this point, then, Democritus is at variance with modern ideas, even in
        the materialist school. To them mind is not an extended substance, but,
        at the least, a function of extended substance. It is not a thing, but
        an act, or, as some of them might say, a permanent possibility of
        action. They may believe that thought and consciousness are a function
        of the brain: they do not identify the brain with the mind. Epicurus
        here, as elsewhere, is on the level of popular thought, which takes the
        soul to be a &quot;thing&quot; among other things, forgetting that even
        in things the main point may not be their capacity of filling space.</p>
        <p align="justify">The refusal to recognise the existence of anything
        beside corporeal substances led Epicurus to some puzzling questions
        about the existence of attributes: the <i>conjuncta</i> and <i>eventa</i>
        of Lucretius.<a HREF="/l%201"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp; The former are the
        permanent and essential qualities, the &quot;everlasting concomitants
        without which body cannot be thought&quot; as they are described by
        Epicurus himself: the latter are the occurrences or phenomena by which
        bodies manifest their action at special times. Grammatically the
        conjuncta are represented by adjectives; the eventa by verbs. These,
        says Epicurus, are distinguishable as aspects, but they never exist
        separately from the totality or aggregate which we know as body. But
        this, though perfectly true, scarcely gets over the obscurity of their
        position <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>as it were half-way between existence
        in the full sense and non-existence. It is only part of the general
        infirmity which sinks the intelligible to the level of the sensible:
        which regards the location of an act as the main point about it. In
        regard to time, a similar question arises. Space, of course, has been
        assumed as the condition of visibility, under the somewhat condensed
        form of the vacuum; but time is still left. Upon that topic Epicurus
        remarks, like Kant, that time is not a conception, and so we cannot get
        an idea of it by examining our preconception, nor can it be made clearer
        to us by substituting for it any phrase or definition. Time, in short,
        he says, being an intuition, is only to be understood as a
        generalization of our consciousness, when we feel time to pass slowly or
        quickly. It is the generalization of what we mean when we distinguish
        days and nights, and hours.<a HREF="#notes08"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;
        But he makes no attempt to see what is implied in the power of making
        such distinctions. We feel it: that is enough.</p>
        <p align="justify">Here Epicurus is at his weakest: metaphysics was
        evidently not his forte. Yet in his indication of the subjectivity of
        time, as part of our way of looking at things, or as a condition of
        sensation, he seems to be on the right route. And generally, we may say,
        that Epicureanism taught in this whole matter a relative truth. It
        rightly lays down that the laws which regulate the movement of masses in
        the visible sphere of mechanics are equally operative in the regions
        subject to physiology. The process of vision may be explained by the
        same principles and methods which are used in accounting for the phases
        and revolutions of the planetary system. There are no special provinces
        in nature living under privileged constitutions, and exempted from the
        operation of the uniformities of causation elsewhere prevalent. The
        realm of physical investigation has no limits <i>in rerum natura</i>.
        Mechanical theories, adopting atomic or molecular hypotheses if
        necessary, are as competent in dealing with the human organization as in
        dealing with the constitution of a block of marble. But when this has
        been admitted, the whole truth has not been put forward. The phenomena
        of conscious life are not explained when their mechanical aspects have
        been analyzed. Scientific theories transgress their bounds when they
        attempt to explain the genesis of mind or soul: they transgress still
        more, when, like Epicureanism, they dogmatically assert the conditions
        for the annihilation of soul.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the view of physical science, intelligence or
        spirit is eliminated from the universe. The world is reduced to a series
        of parcels of matter, deprived of life and consciousness, and regarded
        solely as transmitting motion from one to another. Matter, indeed, is
        either combined with force, or supposed to be identical with force; but
        in either case force is ultimately reducible to motion. All the various
        forces in the universe are exhibited in various complicated and
        disguised forms of movement his doctrine, to which modern science is led
        by its mathematical methods, is the fundamental proposition of
        Epicureanism.</p>
        <p align="justify">And in movement there seems nothing mystical or
        beyond the most vulgar apprehension. It is apparently a fact presented
        again and again in daily experience. If Epicurus had heard of the
        paradoxes of Zeno the Eleatic, about the reality or conceivability of
        motion, he probably looked upon them as frivolous quibbling about a
        point for which the evidence of sense was undoubted. To conceive the
        whole world as an immense commentary illustrating the text that atoms
        and void are everywhere, is an easy task for the imagination. It
        banishes occult properties, metaphysical entities, and fantastic spirits
        from the universe.</p>
        <p align="justify">Atoms in the void, moving freely about like the motes
        we see in the sunbeam, are continually waving their mazy dance
        throughout the endless spaces, and gathering into aggregations of a
        moderate degree of persistence. A variety of worlds, of various shapes,
        sizes, and contents, arises here and there, separated from each other by
        spaces of comparative emptiness. But the worlds thus created by the
        movement of atoms at length disintegrate through similar causes. It
        seems as if Epicurus, following the lead of the Sicilian philosopher,
        Empedocles, had supposed that there was an age in which the powers of
        union were supreme, and an age in which the spirit of discord waxed most
        powerful. And as these changes take place the aspect of things varies in
        detail, though its general features remain unchanged. As in the whole,
        so with the particular world of earth, sun, and stars, to which we
        belong. It, too, has its time of generation and birth; it will, also,
        have its old age, and, as the matron whose days of child-bearing are
        over, will yield its fruit no more.<a HREF="#notes08"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

        cosmology of Epicurus may receive some light if we contrast with it the
        cosmology of Aristotle. With Aristotle the earth, and all that lies
        beneath the circle of the moon <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>is an inferior province of the
        universe. The home of the highest reason is beyond the sublunary sphere.
        The earth lies in the centre of the universe. A series of circles, each
        less perfect than the other, extends from the first, or starry heaven,
        towards the earth. The heavenly element of rather is on a different
        level from the ordinary material of the four terrestrial elements.
        Things are intrinsically light or intrinsically heavy; some of them tend
        towards the centre of the sphere, whilst others tend upwards towards the
        circumference. There is only a single world, or universe: there is a
        limited and rounded totality of things. While the rather on the
        circumference is naturally endowed with a circular motion, the other
        elements move in straight lines up and down. The order and disposition
        of the world are eternal: it has had no beginning, and will have no end.
        There is no empty space in the universe. The starry sphere is in
        immediate contact with the godhead. Indeed, all the celestial spheres
        are regarded as beings endowed with life, and capable of intelligent
        action. But especially is the ethereal sphere the home of superior
        intelligence, which, in serene ease and blessedness, circles for ever in
        its own most perfect motion.</p>
        <p align="justify">Nothing can be in greater contrast with these
        Aristotelian ideas than the system of Epicureanism. Instead of a central
        system we have an endless number of cosmical bodies, no one of which is
        nearer the centre than another. The earth is no longer an absolute
        middle-point, around which the starry world revolves. The starry sphere
        itself is made of a matter not of transcendent quality, but of the same
        constitution as our earth. The world is no longer an intelligent and
        vital being, but a mere product of mechanical unions, coherent only for
        awhile, but destined to disruption. All matter is heavy, all tends
        downwards. And thus Epicurus set aside the pictorially complete
        conception of Aristotle for a new idea, in which the earth and its
        starry and planetary attendants, as well as sun and moon, sink into a
        mere unit in the endless series of worlds. But as he did so, he
        diminished the grandeur of the sun and stars; he made them mere
        dependents and satellites of the earth, and so took up an astronomical
        theory which is even more fanciful and absurd than that of the Stagirite.
        For when a modern speaks of other worlds than this earth of ours, he
        thinks in the first instance of the other planets belonging to the solar
        system: and if he goes further, his imagination is carried on to the
        distant stars, each, perhaps, attended with their planets, and these
        with their several satellites. But such an idea is quite unlike that
        held by Epicurus. The planets and stars are parts of this world in which
        we live, and not very important or extensive parts of it either.<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">The ancients are never tired of expressing their
        surprise and contempt for the astronomical doctrines of Epicureanism. At
        first sight, indeed, it excites unmitigated wonder that Epicurus, living
        in a generation after Eudoxus, and not long preceding the two great
        astronomers, Aristarchus of Samos, and Hipparchus of Nicaea, should
        propound the doctrine that the sun and the stars are of the same
        magnitude as they appear to be, or, at any rate, only differ
        inappreciably from their apparent size. Nor did the Epicureans fail to
        argue from the facts of daily observation in favour of this doctrine,
        alleging that distance makes little or no difference in the size of
        terrestrial flames so long as their light remains at all visible.
        &quot;Had the size been diminished to the eye of the distance, much more
        would the colour have been altered.&quot; So says Epicurus in the 11th
        book of his work of Nature; but the fragments of that book restored from
        Herculaneum help us little. All that we can see is, that Epicurus,
        distrusting all lengthy argument from various facts, supplemented and
        defined by the help of mathematics, adheres solely to argumentation
        based on the immediate data of observation. The reasoning by which
        Aristarchus attempted to answer these problems in his book on the
        magnitudes and distances of the sun and moon, was of a recondite,
        mathematical character; while the speculations of Eudoxus on the same
        topic (he believed the diameter of the sun to be nine times greater than
        that of the moon) were complicated by the introduction of celestial
        spheres.<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">This indifference to astronomical science is evident
        in other points. It cost no trouble to the Epicureans to suggest the
        idea that the sun and moon are born afresh every morning and every
        evening: that at fixed times the germs of fire which gather in them come
        together, and again at fixed times are dispersed. When we suppose that
        they are merely out of sight it may be that they are really out of
        existence, and a new sun perchance is created every morning, and a new
        moon arises every month to go through its phases in the accustomed
        order.</p>
        <p align="justify">Such is one instance of the general method and
        principle of the Epicurean theory of the celestial movements and
        meteorological phenomena. Both of these Epicurus believed beyond the
        reach of observation. We can never hope, he said, to know the real
        mechanism of the planetary and astral phenomena, or the secret causes of
        the hail or the dew. We know not the ordinances of heaven; we have not
        entered into the treasures of the snow, nor can we bind the sweet
        influences of Pleiades. These matters are beyond the ken of man: we
        cannot attain certainty on such topics, and those who profess to have
        attained it are charlatans, anxious to impose upon the vulgar. The
        ordinary terrestrial phenomena where we can trace the connection of
        causes and effects have, it is true, one fixed and settled reason to be
        given for them, and no more. But such simplicity cannot be looked for in
        the heavens, and there we must be content to accept a number of
        solutions or explanations as, in our state of ignorance, equally
        probable.</p>
        <p align="justify">It would be wrong to suppose from this that Epicurus
        regarded astronomical and meteorological phenomena as merely casual,
        governed by no laws, and exhibiting no regularity. His attitude is
        rather that of one who distrusts the capacities of science, and is
        especially suspicious of results won by the help of mathematical
        processes which are inaccessible to the multitude. The fundamental
        principles of scientific inquiry he accepts, but he cannot follow the
        intricate methods by which science establishes its results. Let us
        remember that his main end is a practical one, to free men's minds from
        the superstitious terrors connected, for example, with eclipses or with
        thunder. For that purpose any explanation which is in accordance with
        observed facts, and not controverted by accepted laws of nature, is
        sufficient. Probability is all that we can look for here, and it is all
        that we need.<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp; Each phenomenon
        is, as it were, taken isolated from the others, and considered on its
        own account. So long as we maintain this position, obviously several
        explanations may seem equally probable, and to adopt any one of them
        absolutely, to the rejection of all the others, would seem an
        unjustifiable proceeding, an instance of mythologizing, as Epicurus
        would say, instead of physiologizing. But it is the mistake of Epicurus
        to stop short at this point. It is only by an act of abstraction that we
        have thus dissevered one phenomenon from its connections. Each forms a
        unity with others, and cannot strictly be explained without taking them
        into account. The more circumstances we take into account, the more our
        room for a variety of hypothetical explanations is narrowed. At last,
        when the whole of the correlated phenomena are embraced within our view,
        no more than a single explanation is possible.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus, therefore, was wrong, but we may still say
        something in his defence. To have waited for an exhaustive and connected
        study of the phenomena in question would have been to postpone the
        solution indefinitely. Even in astronomy, the current explanation of
        planetary movements in Epicurus's day was a mistake, and to assert it as
        a certain truth, as the explanation of the facts, was presumption. The
        worth of Epicureanism lies in its maintenance, even where direct proof
        is out of reach, of the faith that the phenomena of the universe are
        governed by the same laws as have become familiar to us in humbler
        spheres. We may not be able actually to assign a certain and verified
        reason for a particular phenomenon, but we are at least in no doubt that
        the causes at work are perfectly natural and commonplace, and, in
        illustration of this conviction, we can assign various means by which
        the phenomenon in question might plausibly have been produced.
        &quot;Only,&quot; says Epicurus, &quot;let us have no mythological
        explanation.&quot; And he speaks disapprovingly of &quot;those who have
        adopted an impracticable method, and lost themselves in baseless
        theories, by supposing the phenomena to take place in one method only,
        and rejecting all the others which might have been admissible.&quot;
        &quot;They have entered on a realm of inconceivables, and have been
        incapable of noting the visible phenomena which give the key to the
        celestial mysteries.&quot; &quot;They contend with facts, and mistake
        the limits of human knowledge.&quot;<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">It is obvious, therefore, that Epicurus has mainly in
        view the theories of the heavenly movements held by Aristotle and
        Eudoxus. These are &quot;the slavish artifices of the astronomers&quot;
        to which he refers; they are &quot;the devotees of a vain
        astronomy.&quot; It is not the astrology of the sorcerers which he
        condemns, but that of the theoretical astronomers, with its cycles and
        epicycles, its complex machinery for facilitating the evolutions of the
        orbs of heaven, its fantastic ideas of a peculiar virtue in the starry
        globes, its attachment of divinities to the extreme circles of the
        cosmos.<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp; As against this
        gorgeous hypothetical construction, which extended itself further and
        further in order to provide an adequate explanation of every new
        phenomenon, Epicureanism raises the protest that a true theory must base
        itself upon facts, that the only facts obtainable are the familiar
        phenomena of common life, and that there is no hierarchy in the cosmical
        arrangements by which the stars and planets should have a movement and
        laws peculiar to themselves. A hypothesis, he says, must not assume
        unknown and unfamiliar principles for the unknown; it must be based
        upon, and accord with, the familiar. Here, as elsewhere, Epicurus
        insists upon the unity in principle and methods which pervades the
        world, and rather neglects, as unimportant, any difference in the
        various grades of organization.</p>
        <p align="justify">It seems to some extent strange that Epicurus should
        thus attack Aristotelianism and cognate theories for the very fault
        Aristotle had found in Plato. According to Aristotle, the theory of
        Plato assigns to the soul of the world a fate like that of Ixion on the
        wheel <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>an existence without leisure and
        reasonable ease, maintaining without any slumber the forcible movement
        of the sphere.<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp; He contrasts
        with this the tranquil and blessed life of his heaven, which, possessing
        by nature a circular revolution of its own, needs no violence or effort
        to maintain its career, but glides on tranquilly like an immortal god,
        free from care and labour. In such a conception of the heaven, indeed,
        the introduction of a God seems superfluous: he enjoys perfect
        blessedness and repose, has no work or care to trouble him. He neither
        creates nor acts: his life is pure self-consciousness. Himself unmoved,
        he moves the world, not by exerting any activity, but by the attractive
        power in him, by which the inferior is constantly drawn under the sway
        of the supremely perfect. Thus, for each particular movement we are
        obliged to discover a special cause. God, in the Aristotelian scheme,
        because He is the cause of everything in general, is the cause of
        nothing in particular. His dwelling is on the very limits of the world,
        beyond the sphere of our dull earth.</p>
        <p align="justify">In all this we are already far on the way to the
        theology of Epicurus. Careless opponents have described Epicurus as an
        Atheist. But the existence of the Gods is what he never denies: what he,
        on the contrary, asserts as a fundamental truth. The question on which
        he diverges from popular faith is not whether there are Gods, but what
        is their nature and their relation to man. His special tenet is a denial
        of the creative and providential functions of deity. The Gods are away
        from the turmoil and trouble of the world. Going a step beyond
        Aristotle, he assigns them an abode in the vacant spaces between the
        worlds. It is a place of calm, where gusty winds, and dank clouds and
        mists, and wintry snow and frost never come. Its smiling landscapes are
        bathed in perpetual summer-light. There the bounties of nature know no
        end, and no troubles mar the serenity of the mind.<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Such was the Epicurean heaven: there was no Epicurean hell.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Gods themselves were of human shape; not globes
        of rolling matter, nor immaterial forms sharing in endless motion. For
        what higher form can human imagination conceive than the human form?
        Surely, this is of a higher beauty than the shapes of brutes or of
        mathematical figures. It is only with the human form that in our
        experience is reason conjoined; and therefore if we are to argue from
        the known to the unknown, like unto men must be the shape of the Gods.
        And so in all respects, from the highest form of life and intelligence
        with which we are acquainted upon earth, we argue to the higher nature
        of the Gods. But according to Epicurean theory, disembodied spirit is an
        impossibility: body and soul are in the living being indissolubly
        united, and their separation means for both death. Hence the Gods have a
        body, but it is not as our body; and they have blood in their veins, but
        it is different from human blood.<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">In all this, if we remember the fundamental postulate
        of Epicureanism, forbidding us to regard the soul as more independent of
        the body than the body is of the soul, we see a process common in some
        degree to all theology. A God out of all relation or similarity to man
        would be for man unintelligible. In God he believes he will find all
        that is best and highest in himself. If he regards his body as an
        imperfection, he will naturally dwell on the spirituality of Godhead.
        If, like Epicurus, he holds the body no less sacred than the spirit, he
        will imagine his God endowed with an ethereal body. He may, like some at
        least of the followers of Epicurus, go a step further. Regarding the
        Greek as preeminent in culture over all barbarian races, he will believe
        that his Gods in their quiet dwellings and unclouded sky, as they eat
        their angelic food and quaff their purer liquids, converse with each
        other in the tongue of Plato and Demosthenes.<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">But it is only with the eye of reason that these
        blessed abodes and their inhabitants can be discerned. Their nature is
        not gross enough to affect the organs of the sense; far away and
        delicately fine, they escape the tests of the eye and the touch; they
        are barely apprehended by the intelligence of the soul. It is the
        rational soul, not the senses, by which we are brought into relation
        with them. The finer particles of the reasonable spirit are in some
        degree suited to the impalpable structure of the divine nature: like
        meets and apprehends like. It is especially in visions of the night,
        when deep sleep falls upon men, that the soul unsolicited by the
        impressions of the senses, responds sensitively to the images of divine
        beings ever permeating the worlds. A belief in the existence of the Gods
        arose, says Lucretius, because in their waking hours, but still more in
        sleep, men saw forms of excellent beauty, which seemed without burden to
        themselves to move, and speak, and act, and were of grander aspect than
        humanity.<sup><a HREF="#notes09">10</a></sup>&nbsp; These forms were one
        kind of <i>idola or spectra</i>.<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;
        According to the Epicurean theory of perception, vision is a species of
        tactile sensation. From all the solid bodies around us there are
        constantly streaming in uninterrupted flow images, consisting of minute
        particles, which repeat exactly the shape of the body from which they
        spring. But from the divine bodies which, as of finer texture, are
        located in a region beyond the spheres of grosser materiality known as
        worlds <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>there are also streaming effluxes of
        more delicate constitution, which appeal only to the reasonable soul.
        These images as they pass from the Gods to men are not distinguished one
        from another, like the solid objects which we number and separate from
        one another. Endless in their numbers, and indistinguishable in their
        outlines, the mind does not gather from them any idea of a definite
        number of individualized beings. One does not stand solid and
        impenetrable to the others; on the contrary, they pass indistinguishably
        into each other in virtue of their general similarity. Accordingly, the
        Gods we perceive are not distinct individual figures, like the deities
        of the old Olympus. Less substantial and sculpturesque in their
        outlines, they have a generic character of deity about them. But the
        main result of this character of our perceptions of the divine, is that
        the Gods as they want the individuality of solid material objects, gain
        in exchange permanence and everlastingness. Their forms never cease, and
        we do not distinguish individual from individual.<a HREF="#notes09"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Hence, in the ceaseless succession of images of this sublimated matter,
        alike and interchangeable, there grows up an idea that they are eternal.
        If there be, according to Epicureanism, a balance between the two halves
        of nature, so that a preponderance of the transient here should be
        compensated by a preponderance of the immortal there, then we may infer
        from this equality of distribution here and there that the Gods must be
        immortal. But it is extremely doubtful if any such idea of compensation
        by excess here for defect there was an accepted dogma of the Epicurean
        school. It is sufficient to say that the immortality of the Gods was the
        natural conclusion drawn from the character of the images by means of
        which their existence was made known to the intelligence of man.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of the conception of the godhead, then,
        deathlessness, a superiority to the general law of nature, was a
        characteristic. It would be easy to ask, with Tennyson:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">&quot;If all be atoms, how then should the gods,<br>
          Being atomic, not be dissoluble,<br>
          Nor follow the great law?&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="justify">But it is less easy to answer the question. One may
        say, indeed, that the matter concerns not the Gods so much as our
        notions of the Gods; and that this, by the circumstances of the
        transmission, forces us to regard them as eternal. Not less does our
        idea of deity involve the blessedness of God. These two attributes,
        indeed <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:

ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>are, according to Epicurus, the two
        fundamental elements which, in all ages and nations, constitute the true
        idea of godhead <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>an idea which is as widespread as the
        human race.</p>
        <p align="justify">But if these two attributes are maintained as the
        anticipation or preconception of God, then much that is commonly
        attributed to the Gods must be rejected. The godhead, indeed, is still
        worthy of all worship; its excellence and glory are properly met by the
        reverence and joyous regard of mankind. But prayers and vows are out of
        place towards such a being. He is neither weak enough to be biased by
        human offers, nor is he malicious enough to seek to injure man. He
        stands aloof from the world, from the denser play of matters affecting
        the senses. The Gods live for themselves, and have no care for man. Man,
        on the other hand, need have no fear of the Gods. They are powerless
        equally for hurt or help. Any worship rendered to them is inspired
        neither by hopes nor fears, but simply by the outgoing of the spirit
        towards auguster beings enjoying superhuman blessedness.</p>
        <p align="justify">The argument for the existence of the Gods, although
        not a strong one, is in agreement with the spirit of the system. We
        have, as Epicurus alleges, clear and manifest images presented to the
        mind of such beings as, though like man, are superior to the infirmities
        of human nature; and we have also an idea of deity. In this inference
        from an alleged phenomenon of consciousness to the existence of its
        cause, Epicurus follows the analogy of the senses; and from the
        peculiarity attending the reception of the spectral images, he argues to
        a peculiarity in the structures from which they originate. But, in the
        first place, it would be extremely difficult to establish the alleged
        fact of consciousness as an original state of mind. Should we,
        irrespective of traditional beliefs and irrespective of the dreams which
        restore the dead to our intimacy, ever be visited by such phantoms of
        the everlasting Gods? No doubt as the years roll on, the images of
        departed ancestors may recur with a glory and grandeur such as gathers
        round the distant past, and a divine halo may embellish the
        recollections of our forefathers. But this alone will hardly explain
        deity, or justify the procedure of Epicurus in arguing from these
        imperfect premises.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the second place, the inference seems to be guilty
        of the same fault as that leading up to the existence of the soul. The
        Gods or deity are, in the first instance, concluded to be extended and
        material substances, which are visible to the finer sensibility of the
        intellect. In one respect, indeed, their position is peculiar; they have
        no distinctive individuality; the images by which they are made known
        resent a family likeness, and the variety of the Olympian heaven has
        totally disappeared. But whatever be the case in this matter, the fact
        remains, that the Gods are conceived as existing after the analogy of
        the human animal. The godhead is a thing, and to keen perceptions should
        be a visible thing.</p>
        <p align="justify">The whole doctrine amazes. Like the sceptical
        astronomer, Epicurus, looking all through the world, finds that he can
        see no God. And yet a consciousness of godhead does not allow him to
        deny the existence of God altogether. Hence his attempt to explain the
        fact so as not to interfere with his general theory. But the belief in
        such Gods is a mere inference of analogy. <i>Primus in orbe deos fecit
        timor</i>, says Petronius. &quot;It was fear which first made gods in
        the world,&quot; and it is to abolish that fear that Epicurus is most
        anxious. The natural tendency of the untutored mind, which sees a life
        like its own in every object which surrounds it, its tendency when it
        finds its efforts thwarted, or seconded, by no apparent causes, and in
        utter disproportion to the energy expended, is to refer the check or
        assistance to some unseen being of like nature with its own. But in this
        reference to divine power two cases may be distinguished. When the
        individual feels himself one with his tribe or nation, his God is the
        national spirit in its unity and strength, the embodiment of the
        national life; who is thus regarded as the favouring and protecting
        genius who works for every member of the nation that walks according to
        its laws. The individual, firm in the sense of national unity, sees in
        his God a principle and a power which is always on his side, ready to
        fight his battles. Temporarily, indeed, this God may turn away his face
        in anger, and his people may be defeated or punished by plague and
        famine. But for the most part in healthy political life, the religion of
        the State is not essentially a religion of fear, but of joy, in the
        Lord. It is otherwise with the individual. In all that concerns himself
        alone, he meets with many influences which thwart his endeavours. The
        powers unseen are more naturally regarded as adverse than as propitious;
        their interference with human wishes is more palpable than their
        coincidence. And when the feeling of tribal solidarity is broken by the
        collapse of the national State, the spirits of men naturally quail
        before the powers of the unseen world, and a period of superstition
        succeeds the period of national religion. The single believer, deprived
        of the strength he acquired by being a member of a great union, sees
        himself confronted in various directions by the threatened opposition of
        his God. His own consciousness emphasizes more acutely his individual
        acts, than in times of tribal feeling. His sins rise up to witness
        against him. Thus, with the growth of individual self-consciousness, and
        the collapse of national and collective feeling, that thought of a
        presence which is always with us <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        object of dread than of affection or of confidence.</p>
        <p align="justify">In such a situation the Stoics and Epicureans took
        different courses. The Stoic accepted the belief, and even carried it
        out to its extreme consequence. The rolling world, he said, is a living
        indivisible being, controlling the movements of all its parts and fixing
        their relation, so that nothing can take place unforeseen, because every
        event is the inevitable consequent of a chain of causes and a group of
        conditions which are all in the grasp and guidance of the universe. And
        yet the Stoical sage asserts his superiority to fate by affirming its
        decrees as his own. The Epicurean, on the other hand, rejects the notion
        of a single all-embracing universe. There are worlds beyond worlds, but
        they form no united and rounded system. When a man looks outside himself
        he finds only an aggregate of details, a mass of particulars like
        himself. There is no order in the universe irrevocably fixing his place
        and duty; for the universe is in a ceaseless process of change, and will
        not be tomorrow what it is today. A man, therefore, need not be
        dismayed. The worlds beyond worlds, which he might see in thought if he
        followed his teacher, are even as the world in which he lives. There is
        no far-off tyrant or demogorgon in the recesses of the unseen; only
        other worlds, and lucid interspaces between, where tranquil Gods lead a
        life of serenity, and meddle not with the ways of men.</p>

        logic has been in all ages the <i>bête noire</i> of the empirical
        schools. Bacon and Locke, no less than Epicurus, express their contempt
        for the frivolous discussions of deductive logic, for the cobwebs by
        which reasoning attempts to master facts. Formal reasoning, says Bacon,
        constrains the assent, but not the realities. You may prove by
        demonstrative syllogism that black is white, but the fact all the while
        is otherwise. The nets of logic entrap the intellect, but he who keeps
        in the open air of experience can despise their sophistries. &quot;
        Epicurus, the despiser and mocker of all logic,&quot; says Cicero,<a HREF="#notes10"><sup>1</sup></a>
        &quot;will not admit that such an expression as 'Hermarchus will either
        be alive tomorrow or not' is true, though the logicians hold that every
        disjunctive proposition of this shape, either yes or no, is not merely
        true but necessary.&quot; &quot;Epicurus,&quot; he says, in another
        place<a HREF="#notes10"><sup>2</sup></a> (Prof. Jevons seems to agree
        with Epicurus on this point), &quot;is afraid that if he admits this he
        must further admit that whatever happens is due to fate.&quot; To
        Epicurus, indeed, the two things were probably not far apart.</p>
        <p align="justify">Both fall under the charge of unduly accentuating the
        ideal element, of taking the relation of our ideas for a matter of fact.
        They are both forms of the <i>à priori</i>; they claim to anticipate
        and regulate experimental fact. And the <i>à priori</i>, or necessary
        truth, which from given experiences deduces by rational formula certain
        conclusions prior to experience of their occurrence, is unwelcome to
        Epicurus. Alike in mathematics and in deductive logic he disapproved of
        it. He resembles the moderns, who shrink from the iron chain of
        necessary law which science in its onward march seems to be drawing
        tighter and tighter round the free-will of man and the providence of
        God.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus, we are told, rejected logic. But this is
        only by comparison with the technical elaborations of the theory of
        proposition and syllogism by the Stoics and Aristotle. No philosopher
        can altogether avoid logic, unless he ceases to render a reason for the
        creed he holds. But in a system which professedly disclaimed a
        scholastic character, which stood aloof from declamation and neglected
        rhetoric, the ordinary deductive logic of Aristotle, with its
        disproportionate discussion of the questions of necessity and
        contingency <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        of reality <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>would have been of little use. As a
        matter of fact, the ancient logic, especially in the hypothetical
        syllogism, which was the great field of Stoic ingenuity, has left behind
        a memory redolent of sophistical and captious arguments rather than of
        real interest in the metaphysical questions underlying these logical
        disputes. And Epicureanism, whatever its faults, always tried to steer
        clear of logomachies, or verbal arguing.</p>
        <p align="justify">Still, there are questions which no system can
        decline to answer, if it claim to be philosophical, especially in an age
        when a sceptical or critical inquiry has sapped the foundations of
        belief. In the first period of Greek philosophy, from Thales to
        Anaxagoras, scientific inquiry had gone boldly on to inferences,
        transcending the phenomena of observation, with a free faith in the
        power of reason to penetrate all mysteries in the universe. The
        contradictory results obtained in the independent prosecution of this
        method by a multitude of inquirers rather discredited it. And in the
        second stage of philosophy, from Socrates to Aristotle, the analysis of
        ideas, of their connections and relations, had formed the main topics of
        investigation. The mind sought to win clearness in the intellectual
        world with a conviction that when that was accomplished there was little
        fear of contradiction in the external objects. It fancied that if the
        order of ideas was sufficiently discovered, the order of things would
        follow of itself. This assumption was shaken by the destructive
        criticism of the immediate successors of Plato and Aristotle, and by
        Pyrrho. Accordingly, when we come to the Stoic and Epicurean schools,
        the common question that is raised is: how can we know when our ideas
        are true and represent objective fact? Where is reality to be found?</p>
        <p align="justify">It is the same question which at a much later age was
        asked in Germany as the reign of the idealists from Kant to Hegel drew
        to its close. These philosophers, it was urged, have
        &quot;construed&quot; God and the universe in thought: but can they give
        us a reality? Can they construe the book which I hold in my hand? They
        construe the idea of God: but what we want is, not an idea of God, but a
        real living and true God. We want something positive: instead of being
        always led about (in the phrase of Plato)<a HREF="#notes10"><sup>3</sup></a>
        from ideas to ideas through ideas. And that real God we find not in
        dialectic arguments and processes of logical evolution, but in two ways
        much more certain to give reality. The one way is to set aside
        reasoning, and go back to feeling, to our intuitive sense of the divine,
        which is the presupposition and should be the substitute of all mere
        argument on the topic. This was the way of Schleiermacher. The other
        method was to listen to the words of authentic witnesses who told the
        story of the Divine life, and so come directly into contact with the
        record of God's action; as in the former way we were brought close to
        the general spirit of God. This was the way of Hengstenberg.
        Unfortunately, it soon appeared that in the one way as in the other the
        rejected reason had to be reinstated. We must believe with the
        understanding as well as with the heart.</p>
        <p align="justify">Something like this took place in antiquity when
        Epicurus and Zeno attempted to find the principle of reality which was
        missed by Plato and Aristotle. Reality, they declared, must be body, and
        the evidence for reality must be found in the senses. The sensible and
        the material <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        which, according to Epicurus, we have of reality is sensation or feeling

mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:

        our senses tell us, what our feeling vouches for, that, according to
        him, is true and real. But all feelings or sensations have not this
        characteristic. The voice of sensation or feeling, if it is to be
        accepted as a witness to truth and reality, must be clear and distinct,
        palpable, tangible, and unmistakeable. Translating more liberally, we
        may interpret Epicurus in the language of modern philosophy as laying
        down immediate consciousness as the final court of appeal. Clear and
        distinct consciousness is not an unfair equivalent for his <i>?<font FACE="Times New Roman">&#957;</font>á<font FACE="Times New Roman">&#961;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#945;</font>

mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>we cannot but be reminded of an
        important epoch in the philosophy of our country. The problems, and the
        answers to these problems, are to a large extent the same as those of
        Locke and Hume. Sensation and reflection are much in the same
        comparative position and esteem in the ancient as in the modern
        empirical school. Neither Locke nor Epicurus fail to acknowledge in
        general terms the spontaneity of mind. But they do not, as Kant did,
        carry this superficial admission any further: they do not ask for the
        special character or origin of that spontaneity: having admitted it in a
        general way, they feel themselves absolved from the trouble of detecting
        its place in particulars. Hence, sensation has the main burden thrown
        upon it in the account given by Epicurus of the genesis of knowledge.
        Sense gives the real nucleus of knowledge: all else is formal. Sensation
        is never false: it is our inference about sensation which contains the
        germs of error. Even a dream or the fancy of an insane person bears
        witness to reality. Being an effect, it must have a cause. So-called
        optical illusions are only illusions to the mind. The square tower <i>e.g.</i>
        at a distance is seen as round: but what we actually see, viz., the
        spectral husk which is thrown off from the tower, has been really
        rounded in its progress through intervening bodies.<a HREF="/l%201"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;
        The sense, strictly speaking, spoke the truth. Error arose because the
        mind forgot to take account of the friction to which the image or idolon
        is exposed. Error is removed when we have learnt to allow for this
        effect of distance.</p>
        <p align="justify">Undoubtedly Epicurus is right in standing up for the
        senses against those ancient philosophers who treated them with scanty
        courtesy. Without the senses the intellect would starve. But it is as
        well to add that he scarcely notices how intellect, if it is the cause
        of error by hasty and ungrounded inference, is also the only means of
        reaching the truth. It alone can heal the wounds which it inflicts. That
        was the lesson which Plato had taught. Epicurus, on the contrary,
        affirms in the language of Kant that conceptions without sensations,
        ideas severed from experience, are empty and unreal A sensation is an
        ultimate fact; its infirmity lies in its isolation: and it is a source
        of error, in consequence of its susceptibility to combination and
        interpretation. But it must be accepted; it cannot be disputed: in the
        words of Epicurus, every sensation is unreasonable: we feel it, and no
        argument can ever make it not be. Nor can one be used to invalidate
        another.<sup><a href="#notes10a">6</a></sup>&nbsp; These sensations,
        however, do not remain unconnected or isolated points in the mind. They
        naturally form unions, just as the primary atoms do in the outward
        world: sensations combine in various ways and build up the world of our
        ideas. Our conceptions gradually amalgamate and combine in obedience to
        such circumstances as conjuncture of occurrence, similarity of nature,
        similarity of relations, and the like.<sup><a href="#notes10a">7</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So far Epicurus and the Stoics agree: and the same doctrine of the
        genesis of our conceptions from the agglutination, assimilation, and
        combination of simpler elements is common ground in all experiential
        psychology. Long before reasoning and reflection awake in any individual
        to form conscious and deliberate associations between the successive
        states of mind, the psychical or physical machinery has been silently
        forming its complex structure from the rudiments furnished by the
        senses. It is not, for instance, by a conscious act of comparison that
        the perceptions of colour, taste, shape, size, in an orange have been
        fused into a single conception, called by one name. It is not by
        voluntary reflection that the sensation of this moment calls up the
        accumulated result of past sensations to complete itself. The
        phenomenon, which has been styled <i>apperception</i>, is an important
        factor in the explanation of mental processes. In virtue of this process
        the present sensation is taken up and moulded into a shape determined by
        some familiar habit of the mind. Every mind is in a peculiar state of
        susceptibility to certain impressions. Whatever the original mind may
        have been in the beginnings of organic life, the mind of each conscious
        being, as we know it, always gives a definite reaction, or interprets
        the data of sensation in a special way. Every image on the retina is not
        passively accepted, but is fused with the bent or train of thought on
        which it enters. We are not pure or neutral observers: the mind throws
        out on the incoming perception a motion of its own, and the combined
        movement is what we fancy ourselves to perceive.</p>
        <p align="justify">But apart from the unconsciously operative machinery
        of associations, Epicurus admits the presence of reasoning in these
        combinations which form ideas. What at an early period of life is always
        done without conscious effort comes in later years to be occasionally
        done with voluntary agency and after reflection. Even after certain
        ideas have been formed by processes which underlie consciousness, we can
        go on to the formation of new syntheses of sensations with one another.
        Of course, if it be asked how reasoning is explained by the Atomic
        theory, the answer does not come readily. To give in terms of matter and
        motion an intelligible account of what is to be understood by logical
        synthesis is a somewhat unpromising task. But apart from its translation
        into Epicurean phraseology the statement is one generally accepted.</p>
        <p align="justify">How much is required to constitute a sensation
        effective or perspicuous is what we cannot tell, any more than we can
        state in general language what qualities in a perception
        &quot;constrained assent&quot; for the Stoics. The problem is in the
        last resort to be answered subjectively. A sensation is palpably
        distinct when it is felt to be such: and it is then a witness to
        external reality. The ultimate criterion of certainty is subjective
        consciousness: it cannot be stated in abstract or general rules
        applicable to all cases equally.</p>
        <p align="justify">The point which Epicurus discusses after sensation is
        what he called by the technical term of <i>&#960;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#968;&#953;&#962;</i>
        anticipation or preconception. It is explained as a general idea stored
        up, a right opinion, a conception, or the memory of what has been more
        than once presented to us from without.<a HREF="#notes10"><sup>8</sup></a>
        When we apply a name to an object we can only do so by means of a
        previous conception corresponding to the name: and that conception is
        ultimately an image derived from the senses. Epicurus, in explaining
        these &quot;anticipations,&quot; says: &quot;In the case of every term
        of speech the primary ideas it conveys must be seen (by the mental eye)
        and not stand in need of demonstration: otherwise we shall have nothing
        to which to refer the point in question.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">These preconceptions are not in any true sense
        innate. They are products of observation. Their value lies in being
        common to the mass of mankind, and so affording a basis of argument. In
        the case of any dispute, in which general terms are employed, the first
        question is: What clear and distinct idea can we attach to it? And this
        does not mean, can I define it <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>can I substitute one set of general
        terms for another? But can I really put it before my intellectual vision
        distinctly? Epicurus, like Bishop Berkeley, reduces general ideas to the
        individual images which do duty for them in the imagination. He wants us
        to realize our ideas in a concrete case as the true test of our having
        them. And here, perhaps, is a fundamental fallacy of Epicureanism. It
        holds that truth is identical with what is clearly and distinctly
        conceived. It substitutes imagination for thought. Unlike Spinoza, who
        contrasts the imperfect conception of the imagination with the adequate
        knowledge of understanding, Epicurus abides by what is easily and
        satisfactorily presented to the mind under a pictorial or semi-sensuous
        aspect. Now, imagination most easily reproduces the phenomena familiar
        to us of bodies in motion. The ultimate significance of motion being
        neglected, we stick to the fact we have seen so often, and all the
        processes that occur in nature are presented under the single, aspect of
        movement.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus, however, goes farther even than Lord Bacon
        in his dislike to meaningless or ambiguous language. The chancellor
        proposed in certain instances to remedy the fault by definition of the
        term. But Epicurus would have nothing to do with definition, <i>i.e.</i>
        with generalities and terms upon terms. He wanted a solid ground on
        which to stand. He would not, like the Stoics, allow the existence and
        quasiindependence of a middle region of words between thoughts (or
        mental images) and things. A word only existed as the symbol of a mental
        image: and therefore it must present its credentials in the shape of a <i>prolepsis</i>,
        <i>i.e.</i> a clear and distinct image, conveyable, not in the general
        terms of a definition, but in the precise and particular language of a
        description. Can the conception be realized as an image? If it can, it
        is a safe and satisfactory basis of argument: if it cannot, it must be
        dismissed.</p>
        <p align="justify">A curious example of this dislike to generalities, to
        definitions and divisions, is seen in the contest which the Epicureans
        carried on against mathematics. If we believe Cicero, Epicurus declared
        the whole of geometry to be false: and he couples the remark with an
        expression of surprise as to whether Polyaenus, who had a considerable
        mathematical reputation, had put the whole science aside after he became
        a disciple of Epicurus. We may be sure he did not; and the very
        conjunction of the two statements suggests that Epicureanism rather
        expressed a view of the nature and method of geometrical truth, than a
        doubt as to its scientific value. What the Epicureans principally
        objected to, we infer, were the principles <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>the axioms, postulates, and
        definitions: though others of them, like Zeno the Sidonian, went
        further, and urged that there were points involved in the demonstrations
        which had not been explicitly accepted in the preliminary principles.
        Now, the definitions of geometry have the defect that they cannot be
        represented in any distinct image. No man can conceive an image of a
        geometrical line, or point, or surface; the only image which can be
        raised to meet these terms is that of a physical line or surface, which
        is evidently quite unsatisfactory for the purposes of mathematics. Even
        if we go a step further, we can say that the general conception of a
        circle or a triangle corresponding to the definitions of Euclid is such
        as can only be realized in special and individual instances of these
        figures. We need not particularly care for the abuse which, according to
        an ancient mathematician, they lavished on the proof of the 20th
        proposition of the 1st Book of <i>Euclid</i>, as demonstrating what was
        palpable even to a donkey.<a HREF="#notes10"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp; The
        main ground of their attack on the mathematical sciences was, that if
        they started from false premises (<i>i.e.</i> not in accordance with
        facts), they could not be true; and to this they added a second and more
        sweeping one, that even if they were true, the exact sciences
        contributed nothing to the welfare and pleasure of human life. Here,
        again, we are reminded of Comte and J. S. Mill; and probably Epicurus,
        whom Cicero accused of overthrowing geometry, went no further than Mr.
        Mill, when he says that &quot;the suppositions (from which the
        conclusions of geometry are deduced) are so far from being necessary,
        that they are not even true: they purposely depart more or less widely
        from the truth.&quot;<a HREF="#notes10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">These, then, are the two pillars on which Epicurean
        science reposes; sensations clearly and distinctly felt, and words
        capable of being referred to clear and distinct ideas. In the moral
        sphere the feelings or emotions play the same part as sensations in the
        theoretical. We need only say a word about another criterion of reality
        which was added by some Epicureans and is not excluded by Epicurus
        himself. These were the imaginative impressions of the intellect,<a HREF="#notes10"><sup>11</sup></a>
        and in these we have a method of arriving at truth additional to
        sensation. The precise meaning of this source of ideas, however, has
        long been a subject of dispute. According to one view, they represent
        the free cast of the mind <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:

        Lucretius,<a HREF="#notes10"><sup>12</sup></a> <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>which leaps out to meet the sensation,
        and transforms it into an intelligent perception. That Epicurus
        recognises spontaneity on the part of the mind is quite true; but he
        notices it mainly to show that this participation of the mind is often a
        source of error and delusion. It is, he says, because there is a gap in
        the connection between the movement which originates from within and
        that which comes from without, that our opinions sometimes are false.<a HREF="#notes10a"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;
        But this meaning would be out of place here. The &quot;imaginative
        impressions on the intellect&quot; are contrasted with the sensations in
        such a way as to render it more probable that we should understand by
        them the images which present themselves to the intellect (in the
        Epicurean description of it), and not to the senses. In other words,
        they represent the impressions derived from the <i>spectra</i> or <i>idola</i>,
        which are too delicate to affect the senses, but can act upon the mind.</p>
        <p align="justify">Such <i>idola</i>, however, are of various character,
        and are of very different value as witnesses to real objective
        existence. Some of those which are incapable of moving the senses are
        due to accidental agglomerations of phantom husks floating about the
        air. For example, in such a way the image of a unicorn may rise before
        the mind. But as the <i>idola</i> come from no real object, no solid
        body (<i>&#963;&#964;&#949;?&#949;&#769;&#956;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</i>),
        as Epicurus calls it), they are not evidence to more than themselves: we
        have the <i>idola</i> presented to the mind; but it is only in sleep, or
        madness, or ecstasy, that we believe these images correspond to any
        reality. When we are awake and in health we soon recognise that we have
        been the victims of illusion. There are, however, <i>idola</i>, which
        like these, appeal to the intellect only, and not to the senses: and
        these are the <i>idola</i> of the Gods. They, too, are not derived from
        single solid bodies; but in contradistinction to the others just
        mentioned they have a real object <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span>or what, at least, is maintained to be
        such in the Epicurean theology. At the same time one can see why
        Epicurus does not distinctly enumerate these imaginative intellectual
        impressions among the criteria of truth and reality. They are not always
        to be depended upon: they are, indeed, generally to be distrusted, and
        trust rested solely on the deliverances of the senses. Yet, Epicurus,
        unwilling to surrender his belief in the Gods, seems to have recognised
        this avenue of ideas solely on account of its theological bearings,
        without minutely discussing or weighing its evidential worth.</p>
        <p align="justify">Two cases seem to exist in which doubt may arise as
        to the reality or truth-bearing quality of impressions. There is the
        case already noticed, of the impressions that solely affect the
        intellect and not the senses. And on this point nothing further need be
        said, except that, where the imaginative forms are not dispelled by the
        comparison with what presents itself in daylight and in our sober moods,
        then they must be supposed to have some reality behind them. The other
        case arises in dealing with strictly sensible impressions. An instance
        may be taken from the field of optical illusions. The oar seems bent
        where it touches the water: two parallel lines seem to converge as they
        retire. In these phenomena it would seem as if the senses were leagued
        to deceive us. But it is really an error due to the addition made by the
        mind to the information given by sense. The mind has transcended the
        merely perceived, and has given it a meaning. Imagination has been
        playing its game with us. In such a case we compare the interpretation
        given by the mind with others which have been already more securely
        ascertained. If the known phenomenon gives its evidence in favour of the
        assumed but uncertain phenomenon, or does not contradict it, the assumed
        perception may be taken as real and true. If, on the other hand the
        familiar phenomenon either controverts the interpretation adopted by the
        mind, or does not witness in its favour, the interpretation must be
        rejected as false.</p>
        <p align="justify">But here there are two cases. There is the case where
        we can by observation or experiment test our provisional hypothesis,
        either by a future examination of the object itself or of others in
        similar circumstances. Thus, when we approach closer to the tower and
        find that it no longer appears round, we are led to modify our statement
        about its shape. But in our attempts to get at the real and secret
        causes of the phenomena of nature, such direct confirmation or
        confutation cannot always be looked for. In such cases, an explanation
        may claim our acceptance if none of the familiar phenomena with whose
        causes we are better acquainted contradict it, or are inconsistent with
        its truth. Thus, the theory that the real substratum of the world,
        external and internal, is to be found in the atoms and the void, cannot
        be proved by direct evidence from sensation. The atoms are too small to
        be singly perceived; and the void, because it is the non-existent,
        cannot be perceived either. Hence, the existence of atoms is only to be
        established, first, when we have shown that any other explanation of the
        phenomena is at variance with observed facts; and, secondly, when we
        have shown that all the phenomena of the universe are consistent with
        the hypothesis of atoms, and that the laws which regulate the movement
        of the atoms are in agreement with the laws which we have found to
        prevail throughout the range of familiar facts.</p>
        <p align="justify">The atomic theory of Epicurus, therefore, is a
        hypothesis, basing its claim for acceptance on the harmony which it
        introduces into our conception of the universe. He began, as we saw, by
        declaring that the individual and subjective certainty of sensation is
        the basis and starting-point of any attempt to reach reality or truth
        and objective certainty. But, though the starting-point, it is far from
        being all that is needful to secure the end we desire. For in every
        perception, i.e., in every interpretation of sensation, there is a
        meeting of elements: the object perceived, and the subject perceiving,
        severally contribute their quota to the result. But the tendency thus
        exhibited is a source of error, as well as of truth. The current of
        impression from the object may lead us into confusion, so also may the
        current which starts from the subject perceiving. In these circumstances
        it is necessary to compare our perceptions with those of others in the
        same phenomena, and to compare similar phenomena with one another at
        different times. In this way we gain a tolerable working certainty,
        sufficient for all ordinary purposes. What others perceive no less than
        ourselves, and what is perceived identically at different times and
        places, may safely be looked upon as real and true.</p>
        <p align="justify">So far as this goes, however, we are not yet in the
        region of scientific certainty. All men agree in perceiving the movement
        of the sun across the sky, its rise and setting; and the phenomenon is
        repeated at different places and times without any variation. The
        perception, therefore, that the earth is at rest, and the sun revolves
        around it, was established as an objective certainty for common use. But
        the Copernican doctrine is a scientific truth which entitles us to set
        the ordinary perception and its certainty aside. How is the step from
        the one degree of certainty to be made to the other? By the same process
        which, when carried to a certain extent, gave the average certainty of
        daily life; by a repetition and extension of the method of comparison
        and correction which was applied to the perceptions of the individual.
        In this way it may turn out that there are constituent elements in the
        accepted perception which are strictly subjective in their origin. The
        aim of the process is to discover an objective certainty, something
        which, in all perceptions, turns out to be a permanent datum. It is the
        elimination of all which is merely subjective which led Democritus and
        Epicurus to assert the theory of atoms. They held that all the phenomena
        of perception could be satisfactorily explained, and, in some instances,
        explained away, by means of their doctrine. They believed that they had
        found in the atoms a fundamental truth by which the process of sensation
        itself could be understood, and things and thought alike receive their
        fair place in the world. A molecular constitution of the world, in which
        the molecules were homogeneous, and only varied in size and shape, and
        that within infinitesimal limits (compared with ordinary visible
        differences), and in which these molecules, though infinitely numerous,
        were always separated from one another by an interspace of larger or
        smaller expanse: this seemed to them to get rid of numerous difficulties
        which any other theories involved, and to produce a conception of the
        universe which was harmonious and accordant with every fact of
        perception.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicureanism, therefore, is far from denying the
        operation of intellectual or rational factors in the process of
        knowledge. What it does affirm is, that in the earliest stages of
        experience a great deal goes on by spontaneous aggregation of the
        materials furnished by sensation, quite apart from the influence of
        reasoning and reflection. Its point is rather like that of Kant in his
        Critique of the Reason. Thought, except so far as it has materials from
        sensation to work upon, is only engaged in building houses upon the sand
        for the tide to sweep away. But in the elaboration of that material, in
        a criticism and sifting of the ideas which have grown up by nature
        thought has its proper function, and obviously a highly important one.
        It may be said, indeed, How can Epicurus, regarding the soul as atoms in
        combination, attach any meaning to its thought? This, indeed, is a
        weighty objection, not, however, only against Epicureanism, but against
        all attempts to render patent the mechanism and operation of mind. And
        further, it is not one whit more difficult for Epicurus to regard a
        concourse of atoms as thinking than to regard them as active in any way
        whatever. It is as hard, and as easy, for an atom to move as it is for
        an atom or group of atoms to think.</p>
        <p align="justify">Like many other philosophers, who in their systematic
        exposition ignore thought and mind, Epicurus starts from the assumption
        of consciousness or mind in activity. The very existence of
        philosophizing presupposes the exercise of thought. But this initial
        adoption of the mental point of view does not, in his case, lead on to
        any further examination of the nature of consciousness, and the
        consequences which flow from the recognition of its powers. He does not,
        like Descartes, proceed from &quot;I think&quot; to &quot;I am,&quot;
        and from our being to the being of an infinite God, the upholder of all
        things and ourselves. He does not, like Kant, proceed specially to ask,
        What are the precise features of this consciousness by which I survey
        the world, and how far do they necessarily mould and form our
        conceptions of nature? He does not even ask, like Plato and Aristotle,
        what are the relations of this thinking to the data of sense, and bow
        the grades and modes of our conceptions of things are to be arranged and
        classified. The problem of classification, involving the questions as to
        the nature of genera and their species, and their relation to individual
        existence, has no interest for Epicurus. The logic of Aristotle and the
        Stoics, with its analysis of the processes of classificatory (dividing
        and defining) thought, is wholly removed in his eyes from any practical
        value. One part of logic only is of interest either to him or to his
        school. And that part is the theory of induction and analogy, and, in
        general, of the process by which we are entitled to extend what we have
        observed in one case to cases lying beyond the range of direct
        observation.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was long supposed, indeed, that because the
        Epicureans rejected the scholastic logic of the Stoics they had given no
        attention to general logical questions. The manuscripts of Herculaneum
        have enabled us to correct this view, and taught us that the Epicureans
        were interested in those questions which lie at the root of all
        inductive logic. The treatise of Philodemus on Symptoms and
        Symptomatization is, as its editor entities it, an essay on inductive
        reasoning.<sup><a HREF="#notes10a">1</a></sup><a HREF="#notes10a"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>&nbsp;</sup>
        It is in the main a defence of the analogical argument from a known case
        to the existence of certain properties in an unobserved case of
        generally similar character. The Stoics, against whom the essay is
        directed, were assailants who refused to admit anything but purely
        deductive reasoning. &quot;How can we,&quot; it is asked, &quot;pass
        from the known and apparent to the unapparent? Must we first of all,
        embrace the whole range of appearances, or certain only amongst them? To
        do the former is impossible; and as for the latter&quot; <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        lurch. But the context shows that Philodemus is quoting an argument as
        to how far we may argue, from the length of life commonly reached, to
        abnormal instances, and enumerating the circumstances which we know to
        make a difference in the length).&nbsp; &quot;As there are variations
        due to air, and food, and physiological constitution, so there may be
        cases due to other differences. Are we therefore either to argue from
        the cases which exhibit no variety of nature or force, or from those
        which present dissimilar features? To start from a completely identical
        case is of no value as a symptom or sign; whilst to argue from a
        dissimilar case fails in proving anything just on account of the
        dissimilarity.&quot; To this the reply of the Epicurean Zeno was:
        &quot;It is not, on the one hand, necessary to examine the whole range
        of familiar facts, nor, on the other hand, are any casual instances
        sufficient. We must examine several instances which, though exhibiting
        variations, still belong to the same kind or class of things, so that
        from what happens in their case, and from the facts recorded about them,
        we may discover the inseparable concomitants of each several case, and
        then carry on the inference to other cases.&quot; Such a rule, though it
        has a slight resemblance to Mill's method of agreement, is too
        indefinite to be of much value. The Epicureans evidently felt that there
        were certain uniformities which might claim the title of natural laws,
        and others which were mere empirical statements; but they cannot state
        in a distinct formula what makes the difference between the two cases.
        They give no sign of feeling the difficulty which lies under the
        statement, that the cases examined are to belong to the same
        &quot;kind&quot; they do not, that is, inquire how &quot;kinds&quot;
        come to be framed either in logic or in nature. Of course, if things
        were all arranged under genera, induction and analogy are easy, and
        perhaps trifling processes. Thus, if we give them the merit as against
        their Stoic and Peripatetic rivals of emphasizing the place of the
        so-called &quot;imperfect induction&quot; in the process of science, and
        of even asserting particular experience as the foundation of all
        certainty, we cannot go further; and must add that, so far as our
        information goes, they did little or nothing towards establishing a
        truly scientific logic of induction. They seem here, as elsewhere, only
        to expound and defend the doctrines of their master, perhaps, as was
        natural, modifying and developing while they only professed to
        apologize. There is little evidence in favour of any influence of
        Epicureanism on the sciences. It no doubt affirmed the law of causation,
        but almost solely against divine interference. Asclepiades, a physician
        and scholar of the time of Cicero, is sometimes said to have introduced
        Epicureanism into medicine; but apparently only on very general grounds.<sup><a HREF="#notes10a">1</a></sup><a HREF="#notes10a"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">As the Epicureans in general rejected logic, so they
        also rejected any metaphysical investigation of the conditions and
        nature of thought. Except as a means of scientific investigation and of
        practical guidance, thought had no interest for them. They, at least,
        could scarcely be accused of introspection, of turning the mind back
        upon itself, of &quot;thinking about thinking.&quot; They ignored the
        self or ego, and if they dealt with it at all, treated it as a thing
        among other things of similar character and agency. They saw themselves
        only as part of the natural universe, and not as occupying a special
        pedestal and possessing a power which might be said to be the basis and
        creator of all things. They found themselves exposed to influences on
        every hand, and making part of an endless series of accidents, of action
        and reaction going on incessantly. This common action, they argued, was
        only possible on the ground of a community of nature. And they were
        right.</p>
        <p align="justify">But they were wrong in supposing that the similarity
        of nature freed them from the task of investigating fundamental
        differences. Like some modern systems, just because the &quot;I
        think&quot; and &quot;I will&quot; accompanies all our perceptions, they
        felt themselves entitled to suppress the ego. They saw it mainly act as
        a cause of error <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        forces. Truth is impersonal, objective: opinion is subjective and
        personal. The intervention of mind seemed to be only a signal for
        mistake and falsehood. And the popular conceptions of mind are not so
        clear as to cause much trouble to such a course. One can find
        indistinctness and flaws in the semi-materialized images which in
        ordinary minds are all that can be found to represent the terms of
        spirit, God, will, freedom, and the like. The products which imagination
        gives its votaries <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        criticism. They are soon shown to contain incompatible elements, to be
        self-contradictory. Ask any one what he understands by the &quot;I&quot;
        of which he constantly speaks; and if he proceeds, like Alcibiades, in
        one of the doubtful dialogues accredited by the title of Platonic, to
        the soul, it will not be hard to show him that he cannot attach any
        clear figuration to what Aristotle defined as the &quot;actuality of an
        organic body, implicitly possessed of life.&quot; The energy of thought
        is by Epicurus always reduced to a phase of imagination: sensation is
        envisaged under the aspect of motion. The ideal world becomes a world of
        visibles in movement. In the world as thus described, there is, to quote
        the words of Professor Tyndall,<a HREF="/l%201"><sup>16</sup></a>
        &quot;nothing which necessarily eludes the conceptive or imagining power
        of the human mind. An intellect, the same in kind as our own, would, if
        only sufficiently expanded, be able to follow the whole process from
        beginning to end. It would see every molecule placed in its position by
        the specific attractions and repulsions exerted between it and other
        molecules; the whole process and its consummation being an instance of
        the play of molecular force.&quot; Of course, for &quot;the attractions
        and repulsions&quot; alluded to by Professor Tyndall, we should
        substitute the impacts of atom upon atom in the Epicurean theory; a
        difference which would not render the process less imaginable. But when
        we come to consciousness and the relation to the physics of the brain,
        the case is otherwise. &quot;Granted,&quot; says the same writer,<a HREF="#notes10a"><sup>17</sup></a>
        &quot;that a definite thought and a definite molecular action in the
        brain occur simultaneously, we do not possess the intellectual organ,
        nor apparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us to pass
        by a process of reasoning from the one to the other.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If we have rightly understood Epicurus, he has simply
        ignored the ego and consciousness, and turned solely to externality. He
        has adopted the attitude of science, and not the attitude of philosophy.
        He has fairly enough employed the ordinary conceptions of matter to
        explain the processes of growth, nutrition, sensation. If not an
        adequate mode of conceiving these processes, it has, at least for most
        minds, the merit of affording an easy and simple rationale of them. But
        as a philosopher he should have gone further. His only answer, however,
        to the question, &quot;What are we?&quot; is, that we are what we see,
        and if our vision were expanded might see. Each of us is an object of
        sensitive and intellectual vision: of the other fact, that each is a
        subject, he says nothing. And by a subject is not meant merely that each
        of us is active as well as passive. For that matter, the same may be
        said of every piece of corporeal substance in the universe: activity and
        passivity are the very characteristics of existence in its very shape.
        But in each of us there is the further element of consciousness,
        sentiment, feeling, will, and knowledge. Of this Epicurus has no other
        explanation than to say that it is nothing separable from certain
        combinations of molecules, and may even be treated as a mere aggregation
        of ethereal atoms.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4">E</font><font size="2">VEN</font> in the lifetime of
        Epicurus his disciples and adherents were numerous. His personal
        influence seems to have acted as a charm. Yet probably his mind was one
        neither fitted for abstruse speculation nor susceptible of deep feeling
        and lofty sentiment. Everything seems to show that he was as indifferent
        to the vocations of the scholar and the artist as he confessedly was to
        the business and intrigues of political life. The magic of his power lay
        in the bright and sweet humanity of his person and character. Possessed
        of a calm and happy temper, which passion and lust did not easily
        excite, and of a perspicuous eye which saw through the hollowness of
        mere word-wisdom and the dishonesty of many social conventions, he
        blended the underlying cynicism of his nature with so much geniality and
        urbanity that no trace is to be found of the sourness of the
        disappointed prophet or of the sternness of the moral reformer. Though
        he lived out of the world, he had nothing of the recluse or of the
        ascetic about him. Unlike other teachers, he was not for ever claiming
        to be called &quot;Rabbi, Master.&quot; He lived among his followers
        like an elder brother; not as a professor among pupils. His was a
        preeminently social nature, finding in friendly communion the very salt
        without which life lost its savour. Women were conspicuous among his
        friends; and without going so far as to call him a ladies' man, one may
        say that he exhibited a decided taste for feminine society; of deeper
        relations to the fair sex, however, there is no indication; and it seems
        improbable that he should have felt a grand passion. His nature was too
        calm and his affections too generically human for that. Perhaps for that
        very reason he was the better fitted to become the focus of an admiring
        and affectionate fraternity. With no wife or children of his own, he was
        more likely to become the correspondent of other women, and to have a
        warm heart for the children of others. Self-centred without selfishness,
        kindly without intensity or passion, wise without pedantry, Epicurus
        naturally had many friends and adherents.</p>
        <p align="justify">The aim and character of his doctrine were also such as to awaken
        interest and win popularity. In name, at least, he proposed pleasure as
        the end of life; and even if the pleasure he meant was not what vulgar
        sensualists understood by the word, the name was one that did not repel
        that numerous class who cannot understand why unhappiness should be
        treated as intrinsically meritorious. A dogma of this kind is perhaps
        especially appropriate to the sunny south and to the bright-souled and
        simple-tasted Greek. Without wholly breaking away from the traditions of
        the national faith, he nullified the power of the priest, the
        confessional, and the indulgence-monger, by denying to deity both the
        will and the power to punish human beings for their conduct. He
        attempted even to dispel the terrors of death and the grave, by
        representing it to a weary world as an endless and dreamless sleep. He
        did not disdain to deal even with precepts of diet and hygiene as
        matters of importance <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span> if life was to be made as happy as it might. To
        explain the origin of the world and man, he gave a theory which called
        for no extraordinary acumen, no preliminary study of mathematics, no
        scientific training, but was level to the comprehension of ordinary
        minds. Professing to build upon the irrefutable testimony of sensation,
        he dismissed logical intricacies as superfluous. Above all, he gave an
        unhesitating dogmatic answer to the doubts and anxieties which perplexed
        men then as they do now, as to whence man comes and whither he goes.
        Instead of criticism and argument, he propounded what claimed to be an
        infallible aim for action, and a complete theory of existence. At last,
        he said, after the world has for ages groped for a way amid the darkness
        of superstition, and after one philosophic system after another has
        tossed men to-and-fro on a sea of groundless opinions, at last the true
        light has been revealed. Henceforth the way seemed to be made clear;
        erring wanderers had only to learn and practise the precepts of the
        Gargettian sage, and thereafter their lives would be happy and their
        souls at rest.</p>
        <p align="justify">It need cause no surprise, therefore, when Cicero declares that, not
        merely Greece and Italy, but the barbarian world lying round soon felt
        the influence of Epicureanism.<a HREF="#notes11"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;
        To minds burnt up by the unavailing strife of politics, and harassed by
        a succession of wars and rumours of wars, a creed which released man
        from the bondage of political life could not but be welcome. After the
        conquest of Persia and the tightening of the ties between Asia and
        Greece, as well as Egypt, which followed that event, the Greek world was
        forced to surrender its burghal exclusiveness, its petty jealousies
        between town and town, its antiquated distinctions of class, its
        contempt for the foreigner and the &quot;barbarian.&quot; The old civic
        constitutions fell in pieces, fortune and power changed hands, the old
        seats of supremacy had to be yielded to young and untried aspirants, in
        the shape of those erewhile secondary states which now came to the
        front. People of alien race and sensibilities got mixed up together. And
        if this was the effect of the Macedonian conquests, still greater was
        the influence of the advance of Roman power in producing like results.
        From that time cosmopolitanism became a fact as well as an idea, for the
        many races brought under the dominion of Rome. To such a cosmopolitan
        society, the great majority in which had, and could have, no interest in
        war and politics, the gospel of Epicurus came as a message of good
        tidings. He pronounced openly the thought which everybody was in secret
        cherishing. He spoke to the poor and the unlearned, as well as to the
        rich and educated. To science and art, to culture and learning,
        Epicureanism was almost hostile, so long, at least, as it saw in them
        attractions which withdrew men from the one thing needful. A mere
        literary and æsthetic as well as a mere scientific training were not,
        according to Epicurus, adequate for man: humanity is greater than either
        art or science. The Stoic philosopher had to tread a mazy path of
        dialectic before he could reach the higher wisdom of life, and to some
        minds the fascinations of difficulty were so strong that they forgot the
        great end of all logic, and spent their lives in intellectual warfare.
        But on the Epicurean there was not imposed the necessity of maintaining
        a lengthy argument in defence of his faith. His duty was to apprehend
        and remember the precepts and principles enunciated by the founder of
        his sect. These principles were simple, and the precepts seemed easy to
        follow. The question was often asked: why are there so many Epicureans?
        No doubt many were attracted by the promising name of pleasure. To such
        might apply the sarcasm of Arcesilaus, who, when asked why there were so
        many deserters to Epicureanism from other schools, while no Epicurean
        ever became a renegade, replied: &quot;A man may become a eunuch, but a
        eunuch can never become a man.&quot;<a HREF="#notes11"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;
        The theology of Epicureanism, too, had its charm. There is an
        unmistakeable earnestness in the tone of Lucretius, when he speaks of
        the awful load of religion under which the world of his time lay
        crushed. And strange as it may sound, the very idea of a divine
        Providence watching over the ways and fates of men meant only the uneasy
        and gruesome sense of a ghostlike presence always hovering around.<a HREF="#notes11"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">The historical circumstances of the age of Epicurus can scarcely be
        dissevered from his doctrines. The wars of the Diadochi, or successors
        of Alexander, the chaos of Grecian politics, and the career of
        Agathocles, the despot of Syracuse, seem a practical and illustrative
        commentary on the morals and theology of Epicureanism. The reader of the
        lives of Eumenes and Demetrius in Plutarch, and of the books of
        Diodôrus, which trace the vicissitudes of Sicilian history from 317 to
        289 B.C., almost feels that he has looked upon a world from which the
        merciful and righteous Gods have departed. A story told of Danaè, the
        daughter of Epicurus's Leontion, may illustrate the impression. This
        lady was the friend and companion of Laodicè, the widow (and murderess)
        of Antiochus the Second. She had learnt that her royal mistress had
        decided to put treacherously to death an officer named Sophron, and she
        gave the latter, who had once been her lover, an intimation of the doom
        intended for him. Sophron made his escape: and Laodice, in her
        indignation, ordered Danaè to be thrown down a precipice. The unhappy
        girl, who had disdained to say a word in the presence of her destroyer,
        broke out, as she was led to her execution, in these words: &quot;The
        world does right to despise the Gods. This is the reward I receive from
        God for saving my husband, while Laodicè, who has killed hers, is
        invested with honour.&quot;<a HREF="#notes11"><sup>4</sup></a>&nbsp; Few
        epochs in history have been so disastrous in their immediate effects
        upon the happiness and the morality of mankind. But, like the wars of
        the First Napoleon, the contests of the tyrants and usurpers of the age
        of the Diadochi perhaps helped to prepare the world for a larger measure
        of freedom and federation.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of the actual spread of Epicureanism during the two centuries after
        the death of Epicurus we are only vaguely informed. But that it did
        spread and that a succession of teachers carried on the tradition of the
        school are certain. It is probably to the close of the third century
        B.C. that we must refer two incidents which are handed down on the
        authority of the lexicographer Suidas. His statement is that some
        Epicureans took up their abode in the town of Lyctos or Lyttos in Crete.
        A decree was at once promulgated for their expulsion. It banished from
        the town &quot;those who had invented a womanish and ignoble and
        disgraceful philosophy, and who were enemies of the Gods.&quot; If,
        however, the offenders should return, (the decree continued) a worse
        penalty awaited them. They were to be set fast in the stocks, naked,
        their skin besmeared with milk and honey, and left for twenty days to
        the stings of the wasp and gadfly. If they survived this horrible
        ordeal, they were next to be dressed like women, and dashed to death
        from the top of 'a rock. At Messenè, in the Peloponnesus, Suidas
        locates another case of like fanaticism. The Epicureans were outlawed as
        defilers of the temples and as a disgrace to philosophy, through their
        atheism and indifference: they were ordered to be beyond the borders of
        Messenè before sunset, and the magistrates were directed to purify the
        city and shrines from all traces of the heretics.<sup><a HREF="#notes11">5</a>&nbsp;
        </sup>We can almost fancy as we read that we are dealing with a
        persecution of the Christians in the second century of the Empire, or
        with the rough methods sometimes employed to check Roman Catholicism.
        One would have been glad to know more of the circumstances, and of the
        special characters of the Epicureans in question. In the absence of such
        details, we may infer that the acts in question had something to do with
        the bitterness and intensity of political enmities due to the contests
        of the Achæan and Ætolian Leagues, of Macedonia and Sparta, during the
        years from 250 to 150 B.C. The offence of the &quot;Epicureans&quot;
        so-called was doubtless political dissidence, rather than religious
        heresy, though the latter charge might be used to justify an attack made
        really on the former ground. In the case of Lyttos, particularly, we
        have the facts of the coalition of the other Cretan states against it,
        and the complete and treacherous destruction of the city by the rival
        town of Cnossos about the year 200 B.C.<a HREF="#notes11"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">The pious and bigoted Aelian, who lived towards the close of the
        second century A.D. wrote a work on Providence, in which the Epicureans
        largely figured.<a HREF="#notes11"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp; From the
        fragments which editors have patched together out of the references in
        dictionaries, we learn that it was full of tales of divine judgments on
        unbelievers, and of miraculous conversions. One of the unconsecrated
        ministrants in the mysteries, he tells us, an adherent of the effeminate
        and impious creed of Epicurus, pushed forward into the most holy place,
        where none save the high-priest might enter, and would thus have
        practically evinced his disbelief in the interference of the Gods with
        man. Suddenly he was seen to shudder, and a wasting disease fell upon
        him. In another story, an Epicurean, who was suffering from pleurisy,
        was taken into the temple of Æsculapius; and while there was told in a
        dream by one of the priests that his only remedy was to burn the books
        of Epicurus he possessed, and apply the ashes kneaded up with wax as a
        poultice. His subsequent restoration to health is said <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span> to have made a deep impression on his fellow free-thinkers.
        Another Epicurean, again, who was heard scoffing at the vows and prayers
        made by the worshippers at the altar of Castor and Pollux, was attacked
        by an offended believer, who seized the sword of one of the Twins and
        smote the reviler, hurling at the same time a blast of defiance against
        Epicurus and his dogmas.</p>
        <p align="justify">Whatever we may think of the truth of these stories, their general
        meaning is tolerably clear. The objections to the Epicureans rest on two
        grounds. The first is their abstinence from political duty: their
        philosophy is womanish. Even in modern times the public mind has
        regarded with distrust those sects which, like the Quakers or the
        Unitarians of Transylvania, have refused some of the recognised
        obligations of the citizen. Much more would an ancient city, obliged
        constantly to defend itself against enemies without and within, abhor
        and punish the advocates of political indifferentism. And apparently
        political life in Greece had been much quickened after the time of
        Epicurus. The reforms attempted in Sparta by Agis and Cleomenes, and the
        extension of the Achaean league, were the closing exhibitions of the old
        spirit of Hellenic life, before Rome reduced all to silence.</p>
        <p align="justify">The second charge against the Epicureans was that of atheism and
        irreligion. In general they were the avowed enemies of superstition and
        priestly deception. Though, like Epicurus himself, they did not
        ostentatiously dissent from the national rites of religion,<a HREF="#notes11"><sup>8</sup></a>
        they were suspicious of all secret worships, mysteries, and the like.
        This position, curiously enough, seems on one occasion to have made them
        the allies of the Christians. In the second century A.D. Paphlagonia was
        ringing with the fame of a new prophet, Alexander by name, who had set
        up an oracle at Abonutichos, which was the object of pious pilgrimages
        from far and near. <a name="lucian"></a> According to the essayist Lucian, who describes the
        rise and progress of this charlatan, the Epicureans, who were numerous
        in the provinces bordering on the Euxine, detected and published the
        tricks by which Alexander managed to impose upon his admirers. The false
        prophet immediately appealed to the fanaticism of the province to
        destroy his opponents, who included Christians as well as Epicureans. He
        waged a merciless war against Epicurus &quot;the man who had studied the
        nature of things, and who alone knew the truth that was in them.&quot;
        To the inhabitants of Amastris, which was the head-quarters of the
        Epicurean opposition, he denied all approach to the privileges of his
        sanctuary. At his solemn religious ceremonial, the service was preceded
        by the herald's proclaiming (after the manner of a similar proclamation
        made at the Eleusinian Mysteries): &quot;If any atheist, Christian or
        Epicurean, has come to spy the sacred rites, let him depart.&quot; And
        as the herald called, &quot;Away with the Christians,&quot; the people
        responded, &quot;Away with the Epicureans.&quot; The catechism or
        articles of Epicurus, even, the prophet caused to be burnt on the public
        square, and its ashes to be thrown into the Euxine. &quot;He knew
        not,&quot; says Lucian in a passage of unusual earnestness, &quot;what
        blessings that book brings to those who come to it, what peace and
        tranquillity and freedom it works within them, setting them free from
        terrors and spectres and portents, from vain hopes and superfluous
        desires, putting within them truth and understanding, and truly
        purifying their souls, not by torch and squills, and such idle
        ceremonials, but by right understanding, and truth and open-mindedness.&quot;
        Of Epicurus he speaks as &quot;a man truly sacred and prophetic in
        nature, who alone knew and taught the good and true, and was the
        liberator of those who companied with him.&quot;<a HREF="#notes11"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">Erelong a third charge was added to the list of impeachments. The
        name Epicurean was identified with sensualist: an Epicure was another
        name for a gourmand. And this view of Epicureanism, which apparently
        came latest, was also perhaps in later times the most widely spread.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is impossible to say precisely when Epicureanism appeared at Rome.
        When the ambassadors of Athens arrived at Rome in 155 B.C. to plead the
        cause of their city in the question of Orôpus, they included no
        representatives of Epicureanism. Carneades of the Academy, Critolaus the
        Peripatetic, and Diogenes the Stoic, carried off the honours of the day.
        Yet Epicureanism had quietly found its way to the capital of the world.
        About the middle of the second century, an obscure statement tells us,
        two Epicureans, Alcius and Philiscus, were expelled from Rome on the
        ground of immoral influence on the young.<a HREF="#notes11"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;
        It is certain that about that period the Roman government made some
        ineffectual attempts to check the corruption of manners and the decline
        of faith, which accompanied the conquest of the transmarine provinces.
        The decree against the Bacchanalia in 186 and the general order given to
        the executive in 161 B.C. to keep a sharp eye on philosophers and
        rhetoricians, betray uneasiness in the governing circles at Rome.<a HREF="#notes11a"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">The earliest expositor of Epicureanism in Latin was a person called
        Amafinius: and the publication of his work was the signal for large
        accessions to the sect of Epicurus.<a HREF="#notes11a"><sup>12</sup></a>&nbsp;
        The attractive power did not lie in the style in which the new doctrine
        was conveyed. The writings of Amafinius, like those of Epicurus himself
        and those of later Epicureans, were written in a vulgar language, and
        dealt with very common things. They were devoid of rhetorical
        embellishments, and even of logical order. The scholarly critic of the
        period remarked that they were <i>said</i> to be in Latin: but he
        regarded them as far from classical in form, and beneath the dignity of
        science in their contents. Cicero himself is fain to boast that he had
        not read them. They wrote, he says, for their own sect, and not for the
        literary world: and as they neglect the graces of style, the public
        passes them by. It is the same argument as a classical author two
        centuries later might have used to set aside the letters of St. Paul or
        of early Christian writers on the ground of defective style. Yet, as in
        the case of the Christian Scriptures, these badly arranged and
        poorly-written words of the Epicureans had the power to convert men. Nor
        was Amafinius alone. A host of writers sprang up in his train, and, in
        the words of Cicero, took possession of all Italy. But the only names
        recorded in literature are those of Rabirius, and Catius the Insubrian.
        The latter died before 45 B.C., and is mentioned by Cicero only
        casually: a later critic speaks of him as a not unpleasant writer.<a HREF="#notes11a"><sup>13</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Even the great poet who wedded Epicureanism to immortal verse, Lucretius
        Carus, is mentioned by Cicero only to say that he agrees with his
        brother Quintus in considering the poem to indicate skill more than
        brilliancy or power. The poem on the Nature of Things <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        the year previously in the forty-fourth year of his age. Poetry can
        scarcely be regarded as an adequate exponent of philosophical doctrine.
        But if we except the abstract exposition of the theory of constituent
        atoms and of vision, Epicureanism with its freedom from logic and
        metaphysics, its direct appeal to the ordinary mind, the pathos of its
        ethical tone, and the humanistic character of its historical philosophy,
        seems more congenial to poetry than any of its contemporary systems. The
        perennial charm of Lucretius is due partly to his dignity and apostolic
        earnestness, partly to his fresh eye for the phenomena of nature and
        humanity.</p>
        <p align="justify">There are other indications of the progress of Epicureanism at this
        epoch. A professor of Greek, Pompilius Andronicus, by birth a Syrian,
        who must have been contemporary with Lucretius, spoiled his chances as a
        teacher of literature by his devotion to Epicureanism. It was supposed
        that his creed would make him indolent in his teaching and less able to
        maintain discipline: and so the poor man saw himself distanced in the
        competition by inferior men. He withdrew to Cumæ, and there living
        frugally and working hard he produced a valuable critical treatise,
        which he was glad to sell anonymously in order to gain a livelihood.<a HREF="#notes11a"><sup>14</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Amongst the circle of Cicero's friends there were many Epicureans <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span> more
        perhaps than members of any other sect. Atticus, a wealthy, cultured,
        and kindly man, who steered clear of politics, stands first in the list:
        and with him one may join Verrius, Saufeius, Papirius Pætus, Trebatius
        Pansa, and Cassius, one of the assassins of Cæsar. Cicero himself drew
        his first draughts of philosophy from the wells of the Epicureans.
        Phædrus, an illustrious member of the sect, contemporary with Zeno of
        Sidon, its head for the time, had found his way to Rome, and about the
        year 90 B.C. gave young Cicero his first philosophical lessons. The
        friendship thus begun was terminated only by the death of Phædrus. The
        orator always speaks of his early teacher with kindly respect.
        Originally esteemed for his instruction, Phædrus, when his philosophy
        had ceased to interest, was still dear to him for his probity, virtue,
        and urbanity. In the year 79 B.C. Cicero spent six months at Athens
        among the philosophers, chiefly attending the lectures of Zeno of Sidon
        on Epicureanism. Not long before Athens had suffered terribly from the
        arms of Rome. In the war between Mithridates of Pontus and the Romans,
        Athens took the side of the Oriental Aristion, or Athenion, a
        philosophical professor, sometimes spoken of as a Peripatetic and
        sometimes as an Epicurean, induced the turbulent spirits of Athens to
        join in the crusade against the great despotism of the West. Throwing
        himself at the head of 2,000 men into the city he got rid of all who
        were too rich or too indifferent to risk a desperate struggle for
        freedom, and made himself absolute dictator. Sulla, after a tedious
        blockade, in which the groves of the philosophers were cut down to
        furnish <i>matériel</i> of war, took the city by storm; and the last
        frantic effort for Greek independence was quenched in seas of blood.<a HREF="#notes11a"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">Cicero subsequently paid a visit to Athens in 51 B.C., when he was on
        his way to the provincial government of Cilicia. Even at this date the
        displacement of the old site of Athens had begun: and in the general
        movement of habitation to the northward the quarters of the city nearest
        the harbour were falling into decay. The house of Epicurus was a ruin:
        and a Roman noble, the very Memmius to whom Lucretius dedicated his
        poem, had got the authorisation of the Areopagus to employ it as a
        building-site.</p>
        <p align="justify">Whether the proposed edifice was a memorial to Epicurus we know not:
        at any rate, the Epicureans were alarmed at the suggestion to desecrate
        their holy places. Patro, who was now the head of the sect, wrote to
        Cicero, whom Phædrus had interested in the question, and asked him to
        interfere and maintain for the sake of the society, &quot;honour, duty,
        testamentary right, the injunction of Epicurus, the protest raised by
        Phædrus, the abode, the dwelling, the footprints of illustrious
        men.&quot; As Atticus supported the request, Cicero promised to write to
        Memmius, who had already abandoned his architectural designs, but was on
        bad terms with Patro. The issue of the intervention is unknown.<a HREF="#notes11a"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">Philodemus, another Epicurean writer of the Ciceronian epoch, has,

        dogmas. Both Seneca and Juvenal speak of Epicureanism in no inimical
        terms. Quintilian seems to have been chiefly struck by its hostility to
        liberal culture.<a HREF="#notes11a"><sup>18</sup></a>&nbsp; Its schools
        at Athens were still frequented. Apollonius of Tyana, who went the round
        of the sects, heard a course on Epicureanism: &quot;for even it he did
        not disdain to study.&quot;<a HREF="#notes11a"><sup>19</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Two Epicureans are mentioned in the symposium of Plutarch. The treatise
        of Lucian <a href="#lucian">above</a> alluded to is addressed to an Epicurean named Celsus, who lived in the time
        of Hadrian. He has been identified by Origen and subsequent writers with
        the author of the <i>&quot;True Discourse,&quot;</i> the earliest
        polemic against Christianity which remains to us; but almost certainly
        this identification is a mistake.</p>
        <p align="justify">About the year 176 A.D., the Emperor Marcus Aurelius assigned to each
        of the four schools of ancient philosophy a yearly revenue of 10,000
        drachmæ.<a HREF="#notes11a"><sup>20</sup></a>&nbsp; Whether this sum
        went to a single professor, or was divided among several, we know not.
        We are told that the emperor left the choice of the professor to Herodes
        Atticus, the patron of philosophy in that period. After his time the
        appointment seems to have been vested, probably, in the Areopagus, who
        decided after hearing the competitors. Of these professors of
        Epicureanism we hear nothing. Aulus Gellius, who studied philosophy at
        Athens while Herodes Atticus was there, hardly alludes to Epicureanism,
        save to quote the bitter words of Hierocles the Stoic: &quot;Pleasure
        the end, is a harlot's doctrine: no providence, is not even a harlot's
        doctrine.&quot;<a HREF="#notes11b"><sup>21</sup></a>&nbsp; Longinus, who
        visited Athens for a similar purpose about 240 A.D., though he speaks of
        the teachers of other schools, does not even mention the Epicureans.<a HREF="#notes11b"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Yet if Epicureanism was not in good odour at the University of Athens,
        it would be a mistake to infer that it had been reduced to silence. The
        physicist Cleomêdes, who cannot be placed earlier than the second
        century, attacks the doctrines of Epicurus in language so vehement that
        one must believe they still had considerable popularity. And Diogenes
        Laertius seems also to testify to its continued existence in his day.
        Yet, in the latter half of the fourth century Epicureanism had no longer
        a following, and even its literature had begun to disappear.
        &quot;Praised be the Gods,&quot; exclaims the Emperor Julian, &quot;for
        having annihilated Epicurean doctrine so completely that its books even
        are grown scarce.&quot;<a HREF="#notes11b"><sup>23</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Naturally, in the closing struggle between paganism and Christianity, a
        system like Epicureanism was out of place. The only philosophy in which
        dying polytheism could hope to find comfort was the spiritualist
        doctrine of Neo-Platonism.</p>
        <p align="justify">The fathers of the early Church have occasionally expressed their
        views on Epicureanism. Tertullian, while he contradicts the theological
        dogmas of the sect, uses language occasionally which is in harmony with
        its fundamental principle. <i>Nihil est incorporale nisi quod non est:</i>
        and, <i>Omne quod est, corpus est sui generis</i>.<a HREF="#notes11b"><sup>24</sup></a>
        (Nothing is incorporeal except the nonexistent: Everything which is, is
        a body of its kind.) And when he boldly declares that the Christian
        regards the teaching of secular literature as folly in the sight of God,
        he seems to re-echo in part the words of Epicurus.<a HREF="#notes11b"><sup>25</sup></a>&nbsp;
        Lactantius, in his <i>&quot;Divine Institutes&quot;</i> (310 A.D.), has
        given a fine enumeration of the secondary causes which may account for
        the spread of Epicureanism.<a HREF="#notes11b"><sup>26</sup></a>&nbsp; &quot;It tells the ignorant they need study no literature: it releases
        the niggardly from the duties of public beneficence: it forbids the

        fight. The godless are told that the gods are indifferent: the selfish

        man does everything for his own sake. The recluse hears the praises of
        solitude; and the miser learns that life can be supported on water and
        polenta. The man who hates his wife is presented with a list of the
        blessings of celibacy: the parent of a worthless offspring hears how
        good a thing is childlessness: the children of impious parents are told
        that there is no natural obligation upon them. The weak and luxurious
        are reminded that pain is the worst of all evils; and the brave man,
        that the sage is happy even in tortures. Those who are ambitious are
        bidden to court the sovereign; and those who shrink from worry are
        directed to avoid the palace.&quot; It is in a fairer tone that Gregory
        Nazianzen speaks of Epicurus as showing, by his temperate life, that the
        pleasure he preached was not the vulgar delights of licence.<a HREF="#notes11b"><sup>27</sup></a>&nbsp;
        No doubt this last was the current interpretation; and it seems to have
        been in the mind of Augustine, when in unregenerate days he would have
        given Epicureanism the palm, if only immortality had not turned the
        scale.<a HREF="#notes11b"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">From the third to the seventeenth century, Epicureanism was dormant
        as a system. The name, however, still survived as a stigma. Amongst the
        Rabbinical writers, the Hebrew transliteration of the word is used to
        denote a free-thinker, loose liver, and transgressor of the Mosaic law.
        Korah, who headed the movement against Moses, and the serpent who
        tempted Eve, are both described by the Hebrew commentators as
        Epicureans.<a HREF="#notes11b"><sup>29</sup></a>&nbsp; Similar was the
        use in the Middle Ages and at the Renaissance. Thus, Villani declares
        that the troubles of Florence (1115-1117) were &quot;not without cause
        and judgment of God, because the city was in those times exceedingly
        corrupted by heresy, and among the others the heresy of the Epicureans <i>pervitio
        di lussuria et di gola</i>, whereby the people of the city were so
        divided they defended the said heresy with armed hand.&quot;<a HREF="#notes11b"><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp;
        And, again, speaking of Manfred, Villani says <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        Epicurean, not believing in God or the saints, but only in corporeal
        delight.&quot; The same usage occurs in Boccaccio; and writers like John
        of Salisbury illustrate the meaning attached to it. The great Epicurean
        of the time, in some of its good, as well as its bad senses, was the
        free-thinking and free-living emperor Frederick II, of whom Gregory IX
        wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, that he held it wrong for a man
        to believe anything which he could not prove by the force and reason of
        nature (<i>vi et ratione naturæ</i>).<a HREF="#notes11c"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
        <p align="justify">With the Renaissance there appeared sporadically a naturalism, often
        licentious, which sometimes claimed kindred with Epicureanism. Partly
        from a misconception of Christianity, but still more from the peculiar
        conditions of mediæval existence, there had been a long divorce between
        the theology of the Church and the life and language of ordinary
        humanity. The re-awakening of natural affections and instincts into a
        free and passionate life was one of the aspects of the Renaissance, in
        which Epicurean tendencies might be traced. The philosophic expression
        of this revolt and protest is found in a small dialogue by Lorenzo Valla,
        <i>On Pleasure and True Good</i>, written between 1430 and 1435. Here we
        find put into the mouth of a contemporary poet a glorification of nature
        and of the natural law of enjoyment. The delights given through the

        first class of pleasures enumerated. But the advocate of pleasure goes a
        step further, and defends the relaxation of sexual restraints. The
        treatise is a crude and hasty generalization, made under a not
        inexcusable hatred of monachism and conventionality. It turns into
        logical and systematic shape those demands of the heart and passions
        which can only claim our partial sympathy when presented in the colours
        of concrete life.</p>
        <p align="justify">The same revival of the heart and the natural instincts is seen in a
        more mature and tranquil form when we look at Erasmus, Luther, Rabelais,
        and Montaigne. All of them, in their several ways, contend against the
        stagnation of conventionality, against the reign of asceticism <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">— </span> all of
        them are humanists, in the wider sense of the word. The true Christian,
        says Erasmus, is the true Epicurean. The marriage of Luther, the monk,
        with Catharine Bora, the nun, was a defiance to the theological morality
        of the cloister. Rabelais substitutes for the conventual institutions of
        the past an abbey where the restraints of formal rules are abolished,
        and makes the novitiate of young men and maidens the preparation and
        beginning of a useful, happy, and holy life. Montaigne writes with the
        mellowed and kindly cynicism of an Epicurean sage.</p>
        <p align="justify">But it was not till the seventeenth century that Epicureanism
        reappeared as a system. In that age more than one effort was made to
        rehabilitate the philosophic schools of antiquity with the changes
        necessary to accommodate them to Christendom. The most conspicuous of
        these efforts was the exposition and adaptation of the Epicurean system
        by Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655). Gassendi published three works on this
        topic: the first, on the life, character, and doctrine of Epicurus; the
        second, a commentary on the 10th book of Diogenes Laertius; and the
        third, a systematic account of the Epicurean philosophy. In these works
        much was done by comparison, by critical ingenuity, and by sympathetic
        interest, to clear Epicureanism from the obloquy and misunderstanding
        under which it was buried. After pointing out the divergencies between
        Epicureanism and Christianity, he proceeded in a new work, the <i>Syntagma
        Philosophicum</i>, to sketch a system in which what he understood to be
        the principles of Epicurus were carried out, except in those points,
        such as the nature and operations of God, and the immortality of the
        human soul, where Epicureanism is unchristian, and in the logical
        introduction, where he went beyond his guides.</p>
        <p align="justify">The second half of the seventeenth century was a period of
        philosophical excitement in France; and Gassendi had his partisans,
        though neither so numerous nor so well known as those of Descartes.
        Samuel de Sorbière, the translator of Sextus Empiricus, expressed warm
        approval of Gassendi's enterprise. François Bernier (1620-1688) a
        physician and traveller, defended and epitomized the doctrines of
        Gassendi, to whom personally he had shown a really filial affection.
        Another Frenchman, Jacques Rondeau (<i>Rondellus</i>), sometime
        Professor of Eloquence at Sedan, published in 1679, a tiny book on the
        life of Epicurus, which was translated both into Latin and English
        (1712). It is an enthusiastic defence of Epicurus, written with more
        zeal than knowledge, attempting to establish for its hero the possession
        of every virtue. The lighter graces and easy-going morality of
        Epicureanism found a skilful advocate in St. Evremond, whose letters to
        the modern Leontion, as he calls <i>Ninon de l'Enclos</i>, give what we
        may style the Frenchnovel version of the <i>liaison</i> between Epicurus
        and his lady disciple. He finds nothing incompatible in a sensual and an
        intellectual friendship to the same person : which as a general truth
        need not be denied, though one may demur to its special application.</p>
        <p align="justify">In more modern times the two men who in different ways most recall
        Epicurus are Jeremy Bentham and Auguste Comte. Both of them were
        founders of systems of thought which have been the objects of virulent
        attack; both of them attached to them a circle of devoted disciples, and
        have been gradually extending their range of influence. Bentham at his

        serve for a modern Epicurus. Like Epicurus, he aimed at founding
        morality on an intelligible basis of fact, rejecting every tincture of
        asceticism, and especially insisting on the relativity of all
        legislation to human happiness. Like Epicurus, he offends sometimes by
        the blunt, hard language in which he destroys cherished prejudices,
        without seeming to care for the injury he may for the time cause to
        tender consciences and deep-rooted sentiments. In the case of Comte, we
        find enthusiastic disciples contributing towards the support of the
        needy thinker, as in the days of Epicurus. The anti-theological
        character of Positivism, the humanistic religion in which it culminates,
        and the fête-days in the Positivist calendar, are features which have a
        certain similarity to Epicureanism. But it may be added that the
        sentimental tendencies of Positivism set a wide barrier between it and
        the older system; which is strengthened when we take into account its
        merits as a philosophy of the sciences.</p>
        <p align="justify">Guyau's work, <i>La Morale d'Épicure</i> (Paris, 1878) as well as
        those of Trezza, <i>Epicuro e l'Epicureismo</i> (Firenze, 1877) and of
        Conte and Rossi, <i>Esame della Filosofia Epicurea nelle sue foni e
        nella storia</i> (Firenze, 1879) show the interest taken in the subject
        at the present time.<a HREF="#notes11c"><sup>32</sup></a>&nbsp; M. Guyau
        treats Epicureanism mainly as the ancient forerunner of utilitarian and
        hedonistic theories. Signor Trezza gives a somewhat idealized picture of
        it, as the ancient gospel of a full and free humanity, living in the
        perception of the great law of nature and of love, and anticipating by
        two thousand years the advent of true philosophy. In the joint work of
        Signori Conti and Rossi the chief merit is a clear and moderate
        statement of the actual doctrines of the school, so far as they can be
        elicited from ancient documents, with a succinct, if somewhat
        unsympathetic, examination of Lucretius.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the paucity of material, an estimate of the value of Epicureanism
        can scarcely fail to be influenced by the views or sentiments of the
        critic. Yet one or two points may perhaps be stated with moderate
        confidence. Its atomic theory, however crude and unscientific in some
        details, has the merit of clearly setting forward certain principles
        which the physical sciences are guided by. Even if we do not say with
        Hegel, that &quot;Epicurus is the inventor of empirical natural
        science&quot; we may still admit that he comes nearer to stating the
        general method of science than Aristotle. He is the foe of <i>à priori</i>
        methods, of arguing with abstract terms. His restriction of the
        scientific field to what he calls &quot;body&quot; is equally in its own
        sphere an advance. Nothing is gained, and much confusion is caused, by
        mixing up the spiritual with the material. The reduction of all physical
        phenomena to modes of motion, together with a more strictly
        &quot;scientific&quot; conception of what motion is, all proceed in the
        same line of thought. His banishment of consciousness from the scene is
        equally in accordance with the procedure of the sciences in their
        stricter phase. If science is an analysis, then the atomic theory,
        which, setting life and consciousness aside, sees in the world an
        agglomeration of mere lengths and breadths and depths without any
        qualities whatever to characterize them, must be regarded as the <i>ne
        plus ultra</i> of science. Yet in the actual world there is a principle
        of unification : thought, life, action are all synthetic. Of these
        aspects of the world Epicureanism is almost silent. They are accounted
        but temporary and unimportant incidents on the great expanse of eternal
        silence-the wilderness of atoms.</p>
        <p align="justify">In its theological doctrines, Epicureanism may be allowed the merit
        of a vigorous protest against superstition and the more degraded aspects
        of so-called religion. Its arguments have weight against the sacrificial
        rites of polytheism. It distinctly shows that God is not such as one of
        His terrestrial creatures, nor even as the orbs of heaven: that He is
        not to be identified with the world or any part thereof. It affirms that
        we are to conceive of God as having in Himself all that is best and
        noblest in man, and remove from our idea of Him all that is evil and
        miserable. It no less declares that this world has other purposes than
        to serve for the well-being of man, and asserts for the various
        provinces of existence a right to their own independent development.
        But, on the other hand, it puts God outside the world, and reduces deity
        to the level of what is only a brighter and more ethereal humanity. As
        for the grounds on which the existence of these Epicurean Gods is
        proved, they seem utterly inadequate.</p>
        <p align="justify">The psychological basis of Epicureanism is indistinct and apparently
        contradictory. While it claims to rest all truth and reality upon
        sensation, its own theory of the world is confessedly at variance with
        the verdict of sensation. It is reason, and not feeling, which
        pronounces for the atomic constitution of things : it is reason, and not
        feeling, which enlightens a man as to the limitations of life and
        pleasure. The fact seems to be, that by feeling or sensation Epicurus
        meant two things, which he did not distinguish: on the one hand, the
        principle or power of immediate and intuitive certainty, of clear and
        distinct consciousness; and on the other, the power of sense-perception,
        or feeling in its more concrete shapes. What is only true of the former,
        he transferred to the latter. Still on this point Epicureanism may be
        commended for its distrust of mere ratiocination, and its evident
        endeavour to get close into contact with individual reality. It is quite
        right in founding all knowledge on individual perceptions; only, and
        this it does not explicitly state, these perceptions are the product of
        factors which are essentially universal and intellectual. The forms of
        thought it treats as neglectfully as it did the synthetic aspects of
        existence.</p>
        <p align="justify">The moral doctrine of Epicureanism sins mainly by its indefiniteness
        as to pleasure. It leaves the interpretation of what is pleasure open to
        the pleasure or will of each individual. No doubt it assigns to prudence
        or wisdom the task of selecting and regulating pleasures; but,
        unfortunately, wisdom has no idea or ideal to guide it in the task. It
        may be said, that it will be determined in the choice by the
        consideration of what is best for the development and welfare of man.
        Such an ideal of self-realization, however, cannot be formed out of the
        individual consciousness alone : it implies the recognition of the
        solidarity and unity of man with man, as a body in which none lives unto
        himself, and where we are all members one of another. That unity had
        been detected by Aristotle and Plato in the Greek State. Epicurus saw
        that the merely political bond was often a hindrance to development; and
        he cast it aside as only an accident. Yet particular duties all
        presuppose the general conception of duty as the obligation of the
        individual towards something more than his natural self. Hence
        Epicureanism, which ignores any such obligation, must, if unchecked by
        other tacit motives, lead to a life of quietism, of indifference to all
        save intimate friends; and, at the worst, to sensuality and mere
        selfishness. But similar charges may be brought against all systems
        which emphasize exclusively one side of the truth.</p>
