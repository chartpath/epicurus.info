        The Classical Epicureans accounted for this by supposing that the images
        of earth-bound things gradually <i>deteriorate</i> over distance—but
        it modernity we recognize that light rays gradually <i>diverge</i>. <b>Middle:</b>
        Two people gazing at the sunset; the sun appears to be the same size and
        brightness, no matter where one is standing. This phenomenon led the
        Epicureans to assume that the images of celestial objects had a special
        quality which prevented deterioration. In modernity, however, we
        recognize that the size of the sun does not change because the sunrays
        reaching us travel in virtually parallel paths. <b>Bottom:</b> The light
        of the sun does indeed diverge, but not perceptibly at the scale of the
        Earth (represented by the dot on the left).</td>
