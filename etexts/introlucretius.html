1. 
Lucretius</font></p>
        <font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="justify">Of all the great Latin writers, we know least about 
		Titus Lucretius Carus, author of the philosophical poem </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On the Nature of Things </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">(</font><i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">De 
		Rerum Natura</font></i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">). He does not talk 
		about himself in the way that his contemporary Catullus does, and 
		information from other sources is meager and unreliable. St. Jerome, 
		writing more than four hundred years after Lucretius’ death, makes the 
		sensational statement that the poet went mad in consequence of drinking 
		a love potion, wrote in the intervals of his insanity, and committed 
		suicide. Since earlier writers show no knowledge of this story,</font><sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		it can confidently be dismissed as a fabrication, probably designed to 
		undermine the credibility of the materialistic philosophy that Lucretius 
		expounds. The story is used by Tennyson in his poem </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Lucretius</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		and by the contemporary novelist Luca Canali,</font><sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		which is fine; unfortunately, however, it is not always confined to the 
		realm of fiction: under its influence some critics have detected in 
		Lucretius’ work signs of morbid pessimism and even mental unbalance and 
		then have used their “discoveries” as confirmation of what St. Jerome 
		says—a circular procedure that is completely out of order. The correct 
		approach is to consign Jerome’s statement to the wastepaper basket and 
		to approach </font><i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">On the Nature of 
		Things </font></i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">with an unprejudiced mind.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">Lucretius was born at the beginning of the first 
		century </font><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span><font FACE="Times-RomanSC">,
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">perhaps in 99 </font>
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span><font FACE="Times-RomanSC">,
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">and it is most probable that he died 
		in 55 </font><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span><sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		If we assume that the dates 99–55 are correct, he was born when Cicero 
		was aged seven and Julius Caesar was a toddler; and when he died, Virgil 
		and Horace were aged fifteen and nine or ten respectively. Catullus 
		probably died in 54 </font><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></p>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="justify">We know nothing of Lucretius’ family, but, whether he 
		was highborn or of humbler origin, it is evident that he received an 
		excellent education: a master not only of Latin, but also of Greek, he 
		possessed a wide knowledge of the literature of both languages; and his 
		partiality for legal and political metaphors suggests that he may have 
		been prepared for a forensic or political career.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">He was familiar with the city and may have spent much 
		of his life in Rome. He appears to have witnessed military exercises on 
		the Campus Martius (2.40–43, 323–332); he had attended horse races 
		(2.263–265; 4.990) and theatrical performances (2.416–417; 4.75–83, 
		978–983; 6.109–110). His vivid description of the man who leaves his 
		fine mansion in the city out of boredom, jumps into the ancient 
		equivalent of a fast car, dashes out to his country villa as though on 
		his way to save a house on fire and, as soon as he has arrived, yawns 
		and either goes to sleep or returns to the city (3.1060–1067), must be 
		based on his own experience of the restless and unsatisfactory life led 
		by some wealthy Romans.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">It is clear, however, that not all his time was spent 
		in the city. Numerous passages in his poem show his familiarity with the 
		countryside, woods and forests, mountains, rivers, and streams. He has 
		an extraordinary sympathy with nature and possesses the keen powers of 
		observation of an artist. Witness his vivid picture in the opening lines 
		of the poem (1.1–20) of the effect of spring on climate, flowers, 
		pastures, sea, sky, winds, birds, wild animals, and cattle. Witness too 
		his descriptions of animals in the fields: the cow searching vainly for 
		her lost calf (2.352– 366); the flock of sheep and lambs moving on the 
		green hillside, but appearing only as a motionless white blur when 
		viewed from the distance (2.317–322); and the newborn calves and lambs, 
		“intoxicated” with milk, frisking on unsteady legs in the tender grass 
		(1.259–261). The probability is that he owned a villa in the country and 
		spent as much time as possible there.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">A line in Book 4 (1277) has been taken, perhaps 
		rightly, to imply that he was a married man. Several passages in the 
		poem suggest that he was fond of children, but of course do not prove 
		that he had any of his own. The celebrated attack on sexual love 
		(4.1058–1191), which has sometimes been thought to reflect his own 
		unhappy experience of the opposite sex (compare the story of the love 
		potion), is in line with the Epicurean view that while it is all right 
		to satisfy sexual desire, provided that this does not cause one physical 
		or mental disturbance, the passion of love is disturbing and destructive 
		and therefore to be avoided.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">The times through which Lucretius lived were 
		dominated by intense social and political unrest and punctuated with 
		outbreaks of revolution and war. The second decade of the first century
		</font><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span><font FACE="Times-RomanSC">
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">was a period of civil war and 
		bloodshed; and if one takes 99 as the year of his birth, he would have 
		been seventeen when thousands of Samnites were butchered at the Colline 
		Gate near the Quirinal Hill; twenty-six when Spartacus led the great 
		revolt of slaves, six thousand of whom were to be crucified along the 
		Appian Way; and thirty-six at the time of Catiline’s conspiracy. It is 
		hardly surprising that one who, as his poem shows, was so sensitive to 
		human suffering, should have become an Epicurean, a follower of a 
		philosopher who taught that one should take no part in the struggle for 
		wealth and power, who attached the greatest importance to friendship, 
		and who offered his adherents tranquillity of mind.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">The only friend or acquaintance whom Lucretius 
		mentions is the addressee of his poem, Memmius (see section 2, below). 
		But it is fair to assume that he also knew Catullus and Catullus’ 
		poet-friend Helvius Cinna, whom Memmius patronized. There are verbal 
		parallelisms between Lucretius’ poem and Catullus 64 (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Peleus 
		and Thetis</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">), which seem too 
		numerous to be accidental, but we cannot be sure who was the imitator 
		and who the imitated. If Lucretius knew Catullus, he may also have 
		encountered some of those with whom Catullus associated, including 
		Clodia, whose stormy affair with Catullus (exactly the sort of 
		relationship against which Lucretius warns his readers in Book 4) is 
		revealed in Catullus’ poetry, where she is called Lesbia.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">Jerome states that after Lucretius’ death Cicero 
		“emended” (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>emendavit</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">) 
		his work. The Latin verb probably refers here, as elsewhere, to the 
		making of essential corrections to a work in readiness for 
		publication—the sort of corrections that nowadays a proofreader is 
		expected to make. Jerome’s statement is less likely to be of trustworthy 
		origin than to be a guess based on the information, given to us by 
		Cicero himself (see <a href="#II">section 2</a>, below), that he had 
		read </font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On the Nature of 
		Things. </i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">Although Cicero thought 
		well of Lucretius’ poetry, as we shall see, and wrote poetry himself, 
		his dislike of Epicureanism makes it seem improbable that he would have 
		prepared </font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On the Nature of 
		Things </i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">for publication. Someone 
		who is more likely, one would suppose, to have helped Lucretius’ work 
		reach the public is Cicero’s closest friend Atticus, who not only was an 
		Epicurean, albeit a less than fully committed one, but also owned a 
		well-organized publishing business. Perhaps it was his copyists who made 
		the first copies of </font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On the 
		Nature of Things.</i></font></p>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="justify">One naturally wonders whether Lucretius knew other 
		famous contemporaries. Did he meet the Epicurean teachers Siro and 
		Philodemus, the former of whom is reported to have taught Virgil, the 
		latter of whom, a writer of poems as well as of philosophical treatises, 
		made Virgil the coaddressee of one of his books?</font><sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		Was he acquainted with Amafinius,</font><sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		Catius, and Rabirius, who wrote in Latin (unlike Philodemus, who used 
		Greek) and did much to popularize Epicurean ideas in Italy with their 
		prose works? Did he know Julius Caesar, who seems to have had some 
		sympathy with Epicureanism, or Caesar’s destined assassin Cassius, who 
		certainly counted himself an adherent of the school, though, like many 
		Roman Epicureans, he was not obedient to Epicurus’ advice to keep out of 
		politics and public life? We can only guess.</p>

        2. 
        On the Nature of Things</font></p>
        <font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>
		<p align="justify">On the Nature of Things </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">is Lucretius’ only extant work; and, so far 
		as we know, it is the only work that he produced, though it is 
		inconceivable that he had not tried his hand at poetry before he 
		embarked on the composition of his masterpiece, a poem divided into six 
		books and containing about seven thousand five hundred lines</font>.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p align="justify">The meter of the poem is the dactylic hexameter. This 
		is the meter used by Greek epic and didactic poets, including Homer and 
		Hesiod, the philosophers Parmenides and Empedocles, and the Hellenistic 
		poets Apollonius of Rhodes, Aratus, and Nicander. The first to employ 
		the meter in Latin was Ennius (239–169 </font>
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">), 
		author of the epic </font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Annals,
		</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">and he was followed by later 
		writers of Latin epic and didactic.</p>
		</font>
        <font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p align="justify">Although </font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>
		On the Nature of Things </i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">has a 
		didactic character and purpose, it is also an epic—an epic whose theme 
		is the universe, the world, nature, human beings, the soul, death, and 
		the gods. It is to be noted that it is the Muse of epic poetry, 
		Calliope, whom Lucretius invokes at 6.92–95. Because the poem is both 
		epic and didactic, its language ranges from the lofty to the 
		conversational: often, particularly when Lucretius is introducing a new 
		topic, he addresses Memmius much as a teacher addresses a pupil, 
		sometimes calling quite sharply for his attention.</font></p>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p align="justify">The brilliant poetical qualities of Lucretius’ work 
		result partly from his own imagination, observation, experience, 
		reflection, and peculiar genius, partly from his knowledge and subtle 
		exploitation of a wide range of Greek and Latin literary sources and 
		from his mastery of rhetorical technique. Not all the influences on 
		Lucretius’ poetry can be mentioned here. They include the only three 
		poets</font><sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		range of Greek and Latin literary sources and from his mastery of 
		rhetorical technique. Not all the influences on Lucretius’ poetry can be 
		mentioned here. They include the only three poets8 named by him—Homer, 
		Empedocles, and Ennius, all of whom he deeply admired (see 1.117–119, 
		124, 716–737; 3.1037–1038). His debt to Ennius and other early Latin 
		poets is significant: he employs archaic words and forms, and he is fond 
		of compound adjectives, assonance, and alliteration—all prominent 
		features of the work of Ennius and company. But, while his poetry 
		retains the vigor of theirs, it is far more polished, and it is only 
		within the last few decades that scholars have properly noticed and 
		explored his not inconsiderable debt to Hellenistic poetry—poetry 
		characterized by, among other things, learning and refinement.</font><sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		One of the prominent manifestations of his poetic art is the 
		extraordinary richness and subtlety of the imagery that he employs.</font><sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		Another remarkable feature of his writing is the way in which, instead 
		of banishing mythology from his work, as one might expect an Epicurean 
		poet to have done, he skillfully exploits it for his poetical and 
		philosophical purposes:</font><sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		see, for example, the opening passage of the poem (1.1–43).</p>
		<p align="justify">Lucretius probably embarked on the composition of
		</font><i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">On the Nature of Things
		</font></i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">in or about 59: lines in the 
		opening passage (1.41–43) seemingly allude to Memmius’ praetorship of 
		58. When he died, probably in 55, his work, though almost finished, 
		still lacked final revision. Some of the chief indications of lack of 
		revision may be mentioned: there are alternative introductory passages 
		in Book 4 (see note on 4.45–53); at 5.155 there is a promise of a proof 
		that is not provided; and there are places where the transition from one 
		passage to another is very abrupt: see, for example, 5.235, where the 
		argument of 5.91–109 is resumed as if the intervening refutation of 
		belief in the divine origin and character of the world in 5.110–234 were 
		not there. Repetitions of passages, which are not uncommon in the poem, 
		have sometimes been regarded as another sign of lack of revision, but 
		probably Lucretius intended to retain most, if not all, of the repeated 
		passages: repetition is an effective way of getting important facts to 
		stick in the reader’s mind; and a certain amount of repetition is almost 
		inevitable in a scientific work in which the author cannot refer the 
		reader to earlier passages by means of footnotes.&nbsp; Whether the 
		actual ending of <font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On the Nature of 
		Things </i></font>is (as I believe) the intended ending, or whether 
		Lucretius did not live to add the concluding passage that he had 
		planned, is not agreed, but we can at least be sure that he had no 
		intention of writing more than six books: he makes clear at 6.93–94 that 
		he is working on the last book.</p>
		</font>
        <p align="justify">The philosophy that Lucretius expounds in <i>On the 
        Nature of Things</i> is not his own, though he believes in it as 
        passionately as if it were.&nbsp; He faithfully reproduces the doctrines 
        of Epicurus.&nbsp; He has sometimes been criticized for making an 
        unfortunate choice of subject.&nbsp; After all, as he himself was well 
        aware (1.136-139), the presentation of Greek philosophy and science in 
        Latin poetry was no easy task.&nbsp; But he did not <i>choose </i>his 
        theme.&nbsp; It was not a case of wanting to write a poem, looking about 
        for a suitable subject, and eventually deciding upon Epicureanism.&nbsp; 
        Epicureanism had to be his theme.&nbsp; That this is so becomes obvious 
        if we consider his relation to Epicurus, about which he tells us so 
        much.&nbsp; He devotes four magnificent passages, full of emotion, to 
        heartfelt praise of his master (1.62-79; 3.1-30; 5.1-54; 6.1-42).<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup> 
        He regards Epicurus as the spiritual and moral savior of himself and of 
        humanity.&nbsp; Epicurus is to him as Jesus is to a Christian.&nbsp; He 
        has complete faith in him and regards his sayings as infallible.&nbsp; 
        He claims to follow him not in rivalry, but out of love for him.&nbsp; 
        He calls him “father”; he even hails him as a god, not because he really 
        believes him to be divine, but because it is the only description that 
        is appropriate to one who possessed seemingly superhuman qualities and 
        who enabled human beings to create a heaven on earth through the 
        attainment of the perfect peace of mind in which perfect happiness 
        consists.&nbsp; Epicurus had discovered the truth and the whole truth, 
        and Lucretius endeavors to communicate that truth as accurately, 
        attractively, and persuasively as he can.</p>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p align="justify">The Epicurean school was very much a “society of 
		friends.” Epicurus thought that “of all the contributions that wisdom 
		makes to the blessedness of the complete life, much the most important 
		is the possession of friendship” (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Principal 
		Doctrines </i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">27) and that “the chief 
		concerns of the right-minded person are wisdom and friendship, of which 
		the former is a mortal benefit, the latter an immortal one” (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Vatican 
		Sayings </i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">78). In these 
		pronouncements he is referring to something more than ordinary 
		friendship: he means the friendship, fellowship, and love of persons who 
		share the same ideals and the same philosophy—Epicureanism, of course. 
		An Epicurean could find philosophical friends both by joining a circle 
		of adherents and by making new converts. The making of converts was 
		encouraged, and the recommended method of conversion was by personal 
		contact: just as a doctor treats individual patients, so the philosopher 
		treats individually, if that is possible, those who are morally sick.</font><sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		Obviously the situation is different when Epicureans, wanting to make 
		their master’s efficacious remedies available to those not known to 
		them, including those not yet born, communicate them in writing, but it 
		is noticeable that even Epicurean writers, though they want to reach as 
		many readers as possible, frequently address the public through the 
		medium of an address to an individual or to a small group of persons. 
		Epicurus himself does this, and so does Lucretius.</p>
		</font>
        <p align="justify">Whether Memmius, to whom <i>On the 
        Nature of Things</i> is addressed, was Lucretius’ patron or not (I doubt 
        if he was), he is not a mere dedicatee, for Lucretius informs him that 
        the inspiration of the poem is “the hope of gaining the pleasure of your 
        delightful friendship” (1.140-145) – in other words, the hope of 
        converting him to Epicureanism.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that he 
        wants his message to benefit anyone who would read his work, but he 
        speaks to this wider audience, through the medium of his address to 
        Memmius.</p><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p align="justify">Gaius Memmius, a member of a senatorial family and 
		the husband of Sulla’s daughter Fausta until he divorced her in 55, had 
		been tribune, perhaps in 62;</font><sup><a href="#14">14</a> </sup>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">he became praetor in 58 and governor of the 
		province of Bithynia in northwest Asia Minor in 57; in 54 he stood for 
		the consulship but was unsuccessful, and in 52, after being found guilty 
		of using bribery in the elections of 54, went into exile in Greece, 
		where, as we shall see shortly, he showed himself to be no friend of the 
		Epicureans. He is said by Cicero, who was on friendly terms with him, to 
		have been accomplished in Greek literature, but scornful of Latin, and 
		to have been a talented orator, but lazy (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Brutus
		</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">247). He may have been a lazy 
		orator, but he was more energetic in another direction: his adultery 
		with the wives of two of his political enemies, the brothers Marcus and 
		Lucius Lucullus, is reported by Cicero in a letter dated 20 January 60 (</font><i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">Letters 
		to Atticus </font></i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">1.18.3). The erotic 
		poetry that he wrote does not survive: according to Ovid, its language 
		left little to the imagination (<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Tristia
		</i></font>2.433–434), but this does not mean that it was without 
		literary merit, and he showed good taste by patronizing Catullus and 
		Helvius Cinna.</p>
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">Scholars have often expressed surprise that Lucretius 
		chose to address his Epicurean poem to a man of such imperfect character 
		and un-Epicurean behavior, and some have even doubted the identification 
		of Lucretius’ Memmius with Gaius Memmius. But there is no need for 
		either surprise or doubt. Given that Lucretius’ purpose is to enlighten 
		the unenlightened, it would have been very odd if he had not chosen to 
		address someone who was in need of enlightenment and reform. Although he 
		tactfully describes Memmius as a man of good character and good 
		reputation (1.26–27, 140; 3.420; 5.8), he was no doubt well aware of his 
		weaknesses and hoped that he would heed his warnings against the dangers 
		of, for example, ambition and sexual passion. The fact is that Memmius’ 
		imperfections, together with his prominent position in public life, well 
		qualified him to be the addressee of </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On the Nature of Things.</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">&nbsp; 
		There was also something else, something very important, that so 
		qualified him—his interest in poetry.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">When Lucretius decided to expound the Epicurean 
		system in a poem, he was taking a bold, indeed unprecedented, step: no 
		one had done it before in Greek or Latin. In the fifth century </font>
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span><font FACE="Times-RomanSC">
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">Parmenides and Empedocles had written 
		philosophical poems, and Lucretius, who, despite his disagreement with 
		Empedocles’ views, warmly praises him, undoubtedly regarded him as his 
		chief model as a philosopher-poet.</font><sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">&nbsp; 
		Epicurus, however, had discouraged the writing of poetry and, though he 
		could write elegant prose if he wished, usually adopted an arid style, 
		apparently regarding literary adornment as an obstacle, rather than as 
		an aid, to clear understanding. Lucretius is well aware that he is a 
		pioneer, and is extremely proud of the fact (1.921–934; 4.1–9; 
		5.336–337). He is also fully conscious of the formidable nature of his 
		task: he refers to the difficulty of “illuminating the obscure 
		discoveries of the Greeks in Latin verse” (1.136–137); and he draws 
		attention to the inadequacy of his native language (1.139, 832; 3.260), 
		which means that he has to invent many new terms (1.138).</font><sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		It is evident that he overcame these difficulties not only by his 
		genius, but also by sheer hard work: he describes his verses as “the 
		product of long research and the fruit of joyful labor” (3.419), and 
		confesses that he spends “the still calm of the night” working on his 
		poem(1.142–145), reminding one of Robert Bridges’s would be poet “o’er 
		his lamp-lit desk in solitude.”</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">Why did he choose to expound his philosophy in verse 
		rather than in prose? The obvious answer is that he was a natural poet 
		who knew that he could put across his message more effectively in verse. 
		But it is clear too that he believed that a poetic exposition of 
		Epicureanism was more likely to attract and persuade Memmius and no 
		doubt other cultured Romans. In a famous and important passage 
		(1.936–950, repeated at 4.11–25) he explains that, just as doctors trick 
		children into drinking unpleasant-tasting, but beneficial, medicine by 
		first coating the rim of the cup with honey, so he has chosen to coat 
		Epicurean philosophy with the sweet honey of the Muses in the hope of 
		holding Memmius’ attention and enabling him to learn the truth about 
		nature. To what extent it was a question of his instinctively knowing 
		that he must write a poem because his own genius demanded it, and to 
		what extent he deliberately chose verse to suit Memmius and others who 
		had found Epicureanism, as usually presented, off-putting, we cannot be 
		sure. What is certain is that the situation in which he found himself 
		was a fortunate one, because the need to write in verse in order to be 
		most effective as an exponent of philosophy enabled him at the same time 
		to satisfy his poetic aspirations. His philosophical purpose, the 
		enlightenment of Memmius, is both the inspiration and the justification 
		of the poem.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">Does the fact that Lucretius, on his own admission, 
		uses his poetic art to sugar the somewhat bitter pill of his philosophy 
		mean that he is a great poet in spite of his Epicureanism rather than 
		because of it? Does it mean that, from a poetic point of view, it would 
		have been better if he had not been an Epicurean and thus had been free 
		to compose a poem on a theme that lent itself more readily to poetic 
		treatment than an abstruse philosophical system? The Romantics answered 
		yes to these questions: Shelley complains that “Lucretius had limed the 
		wings of his swift spirit in the dregs of the sensible world”; and Byron 
		comments: “If Lucretius had not been spoiled by the Epicurean system, we 
		should have had a far superior poem to any now in existence.” But these 
		criticisms are misguided. As I have written elsewhere: “Certainly it 
		must be admitted that [Lucretius] was a natural poet, and that, if he 
		had taken a more traditional theme, the result would have been an 
		artistic poem. But [<i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">On the Nature 
		of Things</font></i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">] is one of the world’s 
		greatest poems not because it is merely artistic, but because it is also 
		full of passion, fervour, and emotion: the poet is inspired with a deep 
		sense of missionary purpose and puts all his heart and soul, as well as 
		all his intellectual power, into his writing, and that is largely why 
		his work still grips our attention, still throbs with life and 
		excitement. If he had not been an Epicurean, this inspiration would have 
		been lacking.”</font></font><sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		As I have pointed out above, <i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">On the 
		Nature of Things, </font></i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">though often 
		labeled a didactic poem, is also an epic of the universe and of 
		everything in it, including human beings. Even the ultimate particles of 
		matter, the imperceptible atoms, inspire fine poetry, since Lucretius 
		demonstrates their existence and illustrates their properties and 
		movements by introducing many superbly conceived and brilliantly 
		described analogies from the perceptible world. Coleridge’s remark to 
		Wordsworth that “whatever in Lucretius is poetry is not philosophical, 
		whatever is philosophical is not poetry,” though valued by teachers as a 
		convenient topic for essays and tutorials, could not be more wrong: in

		<p ALIGN="justify">The merits of Lucretius’ poetry were acknowledged at

		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">comments: “The poetry of Lucretius is,

		</font>and didactic <font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Georgics, </i>
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">but also in his epic </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Aeneid, </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">and it is undoubtedly Lucretius who is at the 
		front of his mind when he writes: “Blessed is he who has succeeded in 
		finding out the causes of things and has trampled underfoot all fears 
		and inexorable fate and the roar of greedy Acheron”</font></font><sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		(<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Georgics </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">2.490–492).&nbsp; Horace, who toyed with 
		Epicureanism, was influenced by Lucretius, though much less deeply than 
		Virgil was, in early life. Ovid admired </font><i>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">On the Nature of Things, </font></i>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">prophesying that “the verses of sublime 
		Lucretius are destined to perish only when a single day will consign the 
		world to destruction” (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Amores

		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">though he disagreed strongly with 
		Lucretius’ Epicurean views, was influenced by him.</p>
		<p align="justify">So the influence of Lucretius’ poetry is not in 
		doubt. But what of his philosophy? Did he succeed in making any converts 
		to Epicureanism? Certainly he failed to convert Memmius. He must have 
		hoped to rescue him from the stormy seas of political life, and he had 
		warned him about the harmful consequences of ambition (see especially 
		3.59–78, 995–1002; 5.1120–1135); and yet Memmius not only stood for the 
		consulship of 54, but showed himself to be so unscrupulously ambitious 
		that, as we have seen, he used bribery. Moreover, as an exile in Athens, 
		he obtained permission from the city’s authorities to build on the 
		remains of Epicurus’ house, and thus distressed and angered the 
		Epicureans; he appears to have gone out of his way to annoy them. There 
		is a simple explanation for his behavior. If one assumes, as one 
		reasonably may, that<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i> On the Nature 
		of Things </i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">had been recently 
		published when the Cicero brothers exchanged opinions on Lucretius’ 
		poetry early in 54, its publication can be placed late in 55. Soon 
		afterward Memmius was exiled in consequence of a vice against which 
		Lucretius had warned him. If Lucretius had lived to witness Memmius’ 
		disgrace, he might well have remarked, “Well, what did I tell you?” 
		Memmius naturally felt that he had been made to look foolish in the eyes 
		of the public and took his revenge on the Epicureans in a rather 
		childish way. I am speculating of course, but such an act of 
		vindictiveness would not have been out of character for a man who was 
		probably motivated partly, if not mainly, by spite against his political 
		opponents when he bedded their wives. Although Lucretius did not succeed 
		in converting Memmius, it is rash to assume, as some have done, that his 
		missionary effort was a total failure. There is evidence that he was not 
		only admired as a poet, but also taken seriously as an exponent of 
		Epicureanism.</font></font></font><sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		Virgil was influenced by his thought as well as by his poetry, and it is 
		tempting to suppose that it was a reading of
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On the Nature of Things </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">that persuaded him to study under the 
		Epicurean philosopher Siro in Naples. It would be surprising if many did 
		not derive comfort from Lucretius’ philosophy in the dark days of the

		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On the Nature of Things, </i>
		</font>and the strong attacks that his pupil Lactantius makes on 
		Lucretius suggest that he regarded him as philosophically significant.</p>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="2"></font>
		<p ALIGN="justify">Although Lucretius is not an original philosopher, he 
		deserves to be reckoned a philosopher in that, as Cyril Bailey observes, 
		he has “a firm and clear grasp of a great world-system, which he 
		expounds with a marvellous vividness and completeness.” Whether he 
		relied on a single work of Epicurus, as has recently been argued (see
		<a href="#III">section 3</a>, below), or used several of his master’s 
		works, his presentation of Epicureanism is, to a significant degree, his 
		own, and not only because it is in brilliant Latin poetry rather than in 
		dull Greek prose: it is evident that it results from the extraction, 
		condensation or expansion, adaptation and rearrangement of material that 
		he found in Epicurus’ work, with the addition of material drawn from 
		non-Epicurean sources and from his own experience. All the material is 
		carefully chosen and organized to suit his missionary purpose. He 
		follows Epicurus faithfully, but not blindly: because he lived more than 
		two centuries after his master and was not a Greek, but a Roman, he 
		takes good care to ensure that what is, after all, not a dead 
		philosophical system, but a living faith, is fully relevant to the needs 
		of Memmius and his contemporaries. He puts Epicureanism into an 
		unmistakably Roman setting.</p>

        3. Epicurus and 
        Epicureanism</font></p>
        <font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="justify">Epicurus was born on the island of Samos, just off 
		the west coast of Asia Minor, in 341 </font>
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span><font FACE="Times-RomanSC">
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">His parents were Athenians. His early 
		education was presumably provided by his father, who was a schoolmaster. 
		He is said to have first become interested in philosophy at the age of 
		fourteen. After military service in Athens (323–321), he rejoined his 
		family in the Ionian city of Colophon, near Ephesus, where they had 
		resettled. In nearby Teos he studied under Nausiphanes, a follower of 
		the philosopher Democritus (c.460–c.370), who had developed the atomic 
		theory invented by Leucippus about 440. Epicurus adopted and modified 
		the atomic theory, and it is natural to assume that it was Nausiphanes 
		who introduced him to it.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">In 311 Epicurus moved north to Mytilene on the island 
		of Lesbos and began to teach in public. But he was apparently regarded 
		as a subversive influence and had to leave in a hurry. It may have been 
		this experience that persuaded him of the wisdom of “living unnoticed”; 
		at any rate his first attempt to teach in public seems also to have been 
		his last. He made some converts in Mytilene, including Hermarchus, who 
		was to succeed him as head of the Epicurean school, and he made more 
		converts in Lampsacus, a city on the Asiatic shore of the Hellespont, 
		where he sought refuge. One of his converts in Lampsacus was Metrodorus, 
		the most important member of the school after himself, who predeceased 
		him. Another was Colotes, who, on hearing him speak, fell down before 
		him and hailed him as a god. Colotes’ reaction is indicative of 
		Epicurus’ charisma. Indeed, if he had not been capable of exerting a 
		powerful influence on the minds of others, he would not have succeeded 
		in founding a school that was to be an important presence in the ancient 
		world for six centuries—for three centuries before Christ and for three 
		after him.&nbsp; His followers were noted for their loyalty and devotion 
		to him, and he was revered and loved not only during his lifetime, but 
		also long after his death. We have already seen how Lucretius regarded 
		him. Epicurus encouraged this reverence for himself, because “the 
		veneration of the wise man is a great benefit to those who venerate him” 
		(<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Vatican Sayings </i></font>32).</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">In 307/306 </font>
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span><font FACE="Times-RomanSC">
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">Epicurus moved to Athens and purchased 
		a house with a small garden. His school was often to be called the 
		Garden, while the school founded in Athens at about the same time by 
		Zeno of Citium was called the school of the Porch—the Stoic school.</font><sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		Epicurus taught in Athens for thirty-six years until his death in 270. 
		During this period he seems never to have taught in public, and he left

		He lived a life of great simplicity with his pupils, who included women 
		and slaves. In his last years he was afflicted with strangury (difficult 
		and painful passage of urine), probably caused by enlargement of the 
		prostate. He bore his illness with the utmost cheerfulness and, when on 
		the verge of death and in great physical pain, wrote a letter in which 
		he refers to his great happiness and joy.</p>

		<p ALIGN="justify">Our most important sources for Epicureanism, in 
		addition to those just mentioned, are Lucretius, Cicero, Plutarch, and 
		Diogenes of Oinoanda.&nbsp; Lucretius gives us our fullest account of 
		Epicurean physics. Cicero and Plutarch, though hostile to Epicureanism, 
		provide much information, especially on ethics and, in the case of 
		Cicero, on theology as well.&nbsp; Diogenes of Oinoanda, like Lucretius, 
		was a devoted follower of Epicurus.&nbsp; It was probably in the first 
		half of the second century </font>
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span><font FACE="Times-RomanSC">
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">that Oinoanda, a small city in the 
		mountains of Lycia in southwest Asia Minor, received a remarkable gift 
		from Diogenes, who must have been wealthy and locally influential. The 
		gift was a massive Greek inscription, carved on the limestone wall of a 
		stoa or colonnade. Diogenes explains that he has “reached the sunset of 
		life” and that, before he dies, he wants to advertise the benefits of 
		Epicurean philosophy with the intention of bringing moral salvation not 
		only to his contemporaries, but also to generations to come (“for they 
		belong to us, though they are still unborn”), and not only to the people 
		of Oinoanda, but also to foreigners—or rather to “those who are called 
		foreigners, though they are not really so, for . . . the whole compass 
		of this world gives all people a single country . . . and a single 
		home.” In accomplishment of his philanthropic and cosmopolitan mission, 
		he sets out Epicurus’ teachings on physics, epistemology, and ethics in 
		writings that may have contained about 25,000 words and filled about 260 
		square meters of wall space. The inscription is eloquent proof of the 
		continuing existence of Epicureanism as a missionary philosophy whose 
		adherents regarded it as the saving truth; moreover, it is a valuable 
		addition to our sources: Diogenes’ own exposition of Epicurus’ 
		philosophy is informative and reliable, and there is the bonus that he 
		quotes some maxims and letters written by his master. He was unknown 
		until late in the nineteenth century, when French and Austrian 
		epigraphists found 88 pieces of the inscription. Since 1968, when I 
		started a long series of British investigations at Oinoanda, another 135 
		fragments have been brought to light, but no more than a third of the 
		complete work has been recovered so far.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">The question of which work or works of Epicurus 
		Lucretius used in writing </font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On 
		the Nature of Things </i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">has been much 
		discussed. The obvious difficulty facing those who try to answer it is 
		the loss of so much of what Epicurus wrote, but our state of knowledge 
		about his writings, and especially about </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On Nature, </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">is by no means static. Much progress with the 
		decipherment, restoration, and interpretation of the papyrus texts from 
		Herculaneum has been made in recent decades and indeed recent years, and 
		David Sedley, who himself has made an outstanding contribution to this 
		work, now argues that Lucretius’ only Epicurean source for “the physical 
		exposition in the main body of all six books” (not, it is to be noted, 
		for all the material in the poem) was </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On Nature, </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">especially the first fifteen of its 
		thirty-seven books.</font><a href="#24"><sup>24</sup></a><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		He is careful to stress that he is only talking about “the bare bones of 
		the exposition,” and he gives full credit to Lucretius for the original 
		way in which he handled the material, rearranging it, elaborating it, 
		illustrating it, and of course treating it poetically. Although Sedley 
		probably goes too far in claiming that </font><i>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">On Nature </font></i>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">was Lucretius’ only source in his exposition 
		of Epicurean physics, he certainly succeeds in showing that it was his 
		main source. It is to be noted that Lucretius’ title translates that of 
		his master’s chief work, though it is almost certainly also meant to 
		recall Empedocles’ poem <font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>On Nature.</p>

		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c. </span>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">was dominated, philosophically, by the giant 
		figures of Plato (c.428–347), founder of the Academy, and Plato’s pupil 
		Aristotle (384–322), founder of the Lyceum. The philosophers who 
		followed them could not fail to take account of their views, as well as 
		those of Socrates, even when they reacted against them rather than 
		adopted them. So it was with Epicurus, who was born six years after 
		Plato’s death and was doing his military service in Athens when 
		Aristotle died. His primary concern, like that of Socrates, Plato, and 
		Aristotle, was with moral philosophy, though he had his own ideas about 
		it and, as we shall soon see, natural science had an essential, though 
		subordinate, part to play in his system.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="justify"><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">Formulating his ideas at a 
		time when Athens had ceased to be a great power and the Greek 
		city-states, as a result of the Macedonian conquests, had lost much of 
		their political autonomy, Epicurus offered individuals a different sort 
		of independence—moral independence. Defining philosophy as “an activity, 
		attempting by means of discussion and reasoning, to make life happy,” he 
		believed that happiness is gained through the achievement of moral 
		self-sufficiency (<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>autarkeia</i></font>) 
		and freedom from disturbance (<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>ataraxia</i></font>).</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">The main obstacles to the goal of tranquillity of 
		mind are our unnecessary fears and desires, and the only way to 
		eliminate these is to study natural science. The most serious 
		disturbances of all are fear of death, including fear of punishment 
		after death, and fear of the gods. Scientific inquiry removes fear of 
		death by showing that the mind and spirit are material and mortal, so 
		that they cannot live on after we die: as Epicurus neatly and logically 
		puts it: “Death . . . is nothing to us: when we exist, death is not 
		present; and when death is present, we do not exist. Consequently it 
		does not concern either the living or the dead, since for the living it 
		is non-existent and the dead no longer exist” (<i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">Letter 
		to Menoeceus </font></i><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">125). As for fear of 
		the gods, that disappears when scientific investigation proves that the 
		world was formed by a fortuitous concourse of atoms, that the gods live 
		outside the world and have no inclination or power to intervene in its 
		affairs, and that irregular phenomena such as lightning, thunder, 
		volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes have natural causes and are not 
		manifestations of divine anger.&nbsp; Every Epicurean would have agreed 
		with Katisha in the </font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Mikado
		</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">when she sings:</p>
		</font></font>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><i>But to him who’s scientific<br>
          There’s nothing that’s terrific<br>
          In the falling of a flight of thunderbolts!</i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="justify">So the study of natural science is the necessary 
		means whereby the ethical end is attained. And that is its only 
		justification: Epicurus is not interested in scientific knowledge for 
		its own sake, as is clear from his statement that “if we were not 
		disturbed by our suspicions concerning celestial phenomena, and by our 
		fear that death concerns us, and also by our failure to understand the 
		limits of pains and desires, we should have no need of natural science” 
		(</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Principal Doctrines </i>
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">11). Lucretius’ attitude is precisely 
		the same as his master’s: all the scientific information in his poem is 
		presented with the aim of removing the disturbances, especially fear of 
		death and fear of the gods, that prevent the attainment of tranquillity 
		of mind. It is very important for the reader of </font><i>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">On the Nature of Things </font></i>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">to bear this in mind all the time, 
		particularly since the content of the work is predominantly scientific 
		and no systematic exposition of Epicurean ethics is provided.</font><sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">&nbsp; 
		Epicurus despised philosophers who do not make it their business to 
		improve people’s moral condition: “Vain is the word of a philosopher by 
		whom no human suffering is cured. For just as medicine is of no use if 
		it fails to banish the diseases of the body, so philosophy is of no use 
		if it fails to banish the suffering of the mind” (Usener </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>fr. </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">221). It is evident that he would have 
		condemned the majority of modern philosophers and scientists.</p>
		</font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">As Diogenes Laertius (10.30) tells us, the Epicurean 
		system “is divided into three parts—canonic, physics, and ethics,” 
		though he adds that the Epicureans “usually merge the canonic with the 
		physics.”</p>
		</font>
        <p align="justify">The canonic<sup><a href="#26">26</a></sup> consists 
        of Epicurus’ rules of investigation, his epistemology.&nbsp; It is 
        understandable that it was often not treated separately from physics, 
        because the two are interlinked and interdependent.</p>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="justify">According to the canonic, there are three criteria of 
		truth. The fundamental criterion is sensation (1.422–425). In cases 
		where sensation seems to deceive us, as when a square tower viewed from 
		a distance appears to be round (4.353–363) or a straight oar submerged 
		in water appears to be bent (4.436–442), the fault lies not with the 
		senses, but with the mind, which wrongly interprets the information 
		received by the senses (4.379–386, 462–468). The mechanics of sensation 
		belong to the sphere of physics, and we shall see that sight, hearing, 
		and smell are accounted for by a theory of emanations. The sense organs 
		faithfully record the emanations that they receive, and if, for example, 
		an image of a distant tower is already distorted when it reaches our 
		eyes, they are not to be blamed any more than a camera is to be blamed 
		if it records an already distorted image. It is when we interpret sense 
		impressions that mistakes can arise. When we are investigating things, 
		the aim is to obtain, wherever possible, a near, clear view of them. If 
		we obtain such a view of a round-looking tower, we can be sure that it 
		is indeed round. But if we have a distant view of a round-looking tower, 
		the proper procedure is not to assume that it is round, but to suspend 
		judgment until we can go near and obtain either “confirmation” or 
		“nonconfirmation” of our sense impression of the distant tower. In the 
		case of celestial phenomena and certain terrestrial phenomena such as 
		volcanic eruptions and earthquakes a near, clear view is not possible. 
		However, in investigating such phenomena we must still be guided by 
		sensation. Taking phenomena of our immediate experience as “signs” and 
		making use of analogy, we may be able to make inferences about their 
		nature and causes, though these inferences cannot usually be confirmed 
		when we test them against the evidence of sensation: if the result of a 
		test is not “contradiction,” it may at best be “noncontradiction”; and 
		if, as quite often happens, several theories pass the negative test of 
		noncontradiction, all of them must be considered possible. This 
		plurality-of-causes procedure was justified not only on the ground that 
		suspension of judgment is necessary when one cannot determine which 
		explanation of a phenomenon in our world is the correct one, but also on 
		the ground that explanations that are not valid in our world may well be 
		valid in other worlds. There is the further point that, since Epicurus 
		was interested only in scientific knowledge that helps us to achieve the 
		moral goal of tranquillity of mind, it did not bother him if he could 
		not identify the precise cause of a particular phenomenon, so long as he 
		could show that the phenomenon was natural and not supernatural. 
		Lucretius, in his explanations of celestial and terrestrial phenomena in 
		Books 5 and 6, frequently suggests several possible causes, and in each 
		book he justifies this procedure (5.526–533; 6.703–711)</font>.<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup></p>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="justify">Sensation by itself is irrational and incapable of 
		memory, but the repeated reception of sense impressions creates in the 
		mind general conceptions of all classes of things. Both in Greek and in 
		Latin these general conceptions are often (though not by Lucretius) 
		called “preconceptions,” because, once created in the mind, they remain 
		there, and further sense impressions are referred to them for testing 
		and identification.&nbsp; However, it is important to understand that 
		the (pre)conceptions are not innate, but derived from sensation. Indeed 
		it is because they are derived from sensation that they are valid. 
		Without them, memory, thought, and knowledge would be impossible, and 
		they are the second criterion of truth.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">The third criterion of truth, like the second, is 
		bound up with sensation. This is feeling, or rather feelings—the 
		feelings of pleasure and pain that are the supreme test in matters of 
		conduct and morality. Pleasure and pain will be discussed shortly, and 
		here it is necessary only to point out that Epicurus’ ethics, like his 
		physics, is based on the validity of sensation.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">We turn now to Epicurean physics, the first 
		principles of which, established by Lucretius early in Book 1 (149–264), 
		are that nothing can be created out of nothing, and that nothing can be 
		reduced to nothing: compound bodies are formed and then are dissolved, 
		but their constituent material has always existed and always will exist. 
		The universe, which is therefore birthless and deathless, consists of 
		just two ultimate realities—matter and void. The existence of matter is 
		proved by sensation; and if there were no void, motion would be 
		impossible, apparently solid objects could not be penetrated, and a ball 
		of wool and a piece of lead of similar bulk would not have different 
		weights, whereas sensation assures us that all these things occur 
		(1.329–397). The extent of the universe, and that of each of its two 
		ultimate components, is infinite, as Lucretius proves in 1.951–1051. One 
		of his arguments (1.968–983) is justly famous. He invites us to assume 
		that the universe is finite and to consider what would happen if someone 
		went to the very edge of it and threw a spear. One of two things would 
		happen: either the spear would be stopped, in which case there must be 
		matter ahead; or the spear would fly on, in which case there must be 
		space ahead. In neither case has the boundary of the universe been 
		reached. Elsewhere (2.1048–1089) Lucretius argues that the number of 
		worlds in the universe must be infinite.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">In what form does uncompounded matter exist? It 
		exists in the form of an infinite number of absolutely solid, 
		indivisible, unmodifiable, imperishable particles or atoms (1.483–634). 
		The Greek word </font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>atomos </i>
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">means “indivisible,” and so the modern 
		atom, which has been split into subatomic particles, is really misnamed. 
		The Epicureans argued that, unless the elements of matter were 
		indivisible and indestructible, there could be no permanence for the 
		universe, and indeed no existence, for everything would long ago have 
		been reduced to nothing (1.540–550). The atoms are so small that they 
		are individually imperceptible (1.265–328). They are uniform in 
		substance but vary widely, though not infinitely, in shape, size, and 
		weight, and it is these variations, as well as the variations in their 
		movements and arrangements, that explain the diversity of things in the 
		universe (2.333–729). Although every atom is minute, it has a certain 
		magnitude and therefore, despite being </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>physically </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">indivisible, is </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>mentally</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		divisible into a limited number of “smallest parts,” that is to say, 
		parts that are the minima of extension and magnitude. This interesting, 
		but rather difficult, doctrine is expounded by Lucretius in 1.599–634, 
		and he returns to it in 1.746–752 and 2.478–499.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">All atoms, whether unattached in the void or joined 
		in compounds, are always in motion (2.80–141). Those moving freely 
		through the void fall downward by reason of their weight, and fall at a 
		uniform speed despite their varying weights. The idea that they move 
		downward is naive: there can be no “up” or “down” in infinite space. 
		However, the idea that objects of different weights falling in a vacuum 
		move with equal velocity—an idea that Epicurus could not prove by 
		experiment—is correct. But his brilliant inference created a problem: 
		the formation of compound bodies cannot take place without atoms 
		colliding and, if all the atoms are moving in the same direction and at 
		the same speed, how can collisions occur? The answer (2.216–293) is that 
		at unpredictable times and places the atoms swerve very slightly from 
		their straight course. This assumption of an atomic swerve was ridiculed 
		for two millennia: Cicero thought it “puerile” as well as unscientific, 
		and Lord Macaulay pronounced it to be “the most monstrous absurdity in 
		all Epicurus’ absurd theory,” but in the modern atomic age it has been 
		treated with more respect. An extremely important point, which emerges 
		clearly from Lucretius’ account, is that the supposition of the swerve 
		was made not only to explain how compound bodies can be formed, but also 
		to account for free will, which Epicurus firmly believed in, but which 
		the physical determinism of Democritus seemed to have excluded. More 
		over, it would be a mistake to suppose that Epicurus argued that the 
		irregular movement of atoms proves the existence of free will: rather, 
		as Lucretius’ account makes clear, the argument was that the fact of 
		free will proves the existence of the atomic swerve. Unfortunately our 
		surviving sources do not make clear exactly how a random atomic movement 
		makes possible actions performed by choice, but Epicurus certainly 
		believed that by his theory he had preserved the moral independence of 
		the individual. The very great significance that he attached to this 
		matter can be gauged from his statement that “it would be preferable to 
		subscribe to the legends of the gods than to be a slave to the 
		determinism of the physicists” (<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Letter 
		to Menoeceus </i></font>134). Once again we see that his moral system 
		was of paramount importance to him.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">The motion of atoms enclosed in a compound body is 
		not linear, but vibratory, as they continually collide and rebound at 
		intervals that vary according to the density of the substance. Why, if 
		the component atoms of objects are continually on the move, do we not 
		perceive their movement? The answer is simple: since the atoms 
		themselves are imperceptible, their movements too are imperceptible 
		(2.308–322). Every compound body, however solid it may appear to be, 
		contains a greater or lesser amount of void. Lucretius explains that 
		differences in the shapes of the atoms explain the differences in the 
		density of things as well as differences in the effects that they have 
		on our senses of taste, hearing, smell, sight, and touch (2.381–477). 
		Hooked and branchy atoms cohere more closely together than smooth and 
		round ones and affect our senses more harshly.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">Whereas atoms are uncreated, unchangeable, and 
		imperishable, compound bodies, no matter how solid and bulky they may 
		be, have a beginning, undergo change, and eventually are dissolved. This 
		is true not only of ourselves and all the things around us, but also of 
		the totality of the world (2.1105–1174). Like every one of the infinite 
		number of worlds in the universe, our world had a beginning and will 
		have an end (5.91–109, 235–415). Lucretius shows that it is a natural, 
		not a divine, creation (2.167–183; 5.156–234, 416–508); and in his 
		brilliant account of how plants and animals originated, of how primitive 
		human beings lived, and of how civilization developed, divine 
		intervention is wholly excluded (5.772–1457).</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">The continual vibration of the component atoms of 
		objects causes the atoms on the surface to be thrown off constantly at 
		high speed as extraordinarily fine films shaped like the objects from 
		which they emanate. When these filmy images (most often called <i>
        eid<font face="Times New Roman">&#333;</font>la</i> in Greek and <i>simulacra
        </i>in Latin) impinge upon the eyes, they produce sight; and when they 
		enter the mind, they cause thought, if the body is awake, or dreams, if 
		it is asleep (4.26–521, 722–822, 877–906, 962–1036). All sensation is 
		explained by contact. In the case of touch and taste, the contact with 
		the object perceived is obviously direct. In the case of sight, however, 
		the contact is, as we have seen, indirect; and the same applies to 
		hearing and smell: these sensations too are caused by effluences 
		entering the relevant sense organs.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">The mind and spirit, the two components of the soul, 
		are corporeal. Being parts of the body, they are born with it and die 
		with it. Both are composed of extremely small, round, and smooth 
		particles, which accounts for their extraordinary mobility. The spirit (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>anima
		</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">in Latin), the seat of sensation, 
		is distributed throughout the whole body, while the mind (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>animus</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">), 
		the seat both of thought and of emotion, is located in the breast. At 
		death both mind and spirit are dispersed at once, and there is no more 
		sensation or consciousness. Lucretius, who devotes the bulk of Book 3 to 
		explanation of the nature of the mind and spirit and to proof of their 
		mortality (3.94–829), goes on to argue that “death is nothing to us” and 
		that fear of death is unreasonable (3.830–1094). Fear of death is, as we 
		have seen, one of the two main obstacles to tranquillity of mind, so 
		that it is not surprising that Lucretius devotes a whole book to his 
		attempt to dispel it. It is to be noted that the Epicureans regarded 
		fear of death not only as a very bad thing in itself, but also as the 
		root cause of that feeling of insecurity that leads people to compete 
		for wealth and power and often to commit crimes or go to war in pursuit 
		of these objectives. Lucretius, who presents this analysis in language 
		that strongly suggests that contemporary events such as the Catilinarian 
		conspiracy are at the front of his mind (3.59–86), makes the paradoxical 
		but psychologically perceptive statement that fear of death sometimes 
		drives people to suicide (3.79–82).</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">The gods, fear of whom is the other main obstacle to 
		true happiness, exist, but not as popularly conceived. They are material 
		beings, composed of exceedingly fine atoms, but, unlike other compound 
		bodies, they continually gain new atoms to replace those they lose, so 
		that they enjoy immortality. Occupying “the lucid interspace of world 
		and world,”</font><sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup><font FACE="TimesNewRoman"> 
		they are perfectly self-sufficient, perfectly tranquil, and perfectly 
		happy. Even if they had possessed the power to create and govern the 
		world, to punish the wicked and reward the righteous, the whole business 
		would have been much too troublesome for them to have undertaken it and, 
		if they had undertaken it, the world and human beings would not have 
		been as imperfect as they are (2.167–181; 5.156–234).&nbsp; Since they 
		have no interest in our affairs, can they be of any interest or value to 
		us? Are they to be worshipped? One might suppose that the answer to 
		these questions is an emphatic no, but in fact it is an emphatic yes. 
		The gods, being perfect, do not need us, but, because they are perfect, 
		we need them. Although they live out in space, the images that they, 
		like all atomic compounds, discharge are able to penetrate our world. 
		The images are so fine that they cannot be perceived by our senses, but 
		only by our minds (5.148–149). Our visions of the gods, which we may 
		have either when we are awake or when we are asleep, not only are proof 
		of the existence of the gods and of their anthropomorphic character, but 
		also convey to us something of their beauty and tranquillity 
		(5.1169–1182). Such visions are most easily experienced by those whose 
		minds are at peace and, although the gods cannot be influenced by prayer 
		or sacrifice, worship of them is beneficial to the worshipper provided 
		that the worshipper is free of popular misconceptions about them 
		(6.68–78). Diogenes of Oinoanda, one of several writers to attest to the 
		importance that the Epicureans attached to worship of the gods, 
		criticizes Homer for representing them as physically or morally 
		imperfect; and he also criticizes sculptors for portraying them as 
		formidable and irascible: instead, he says, “We ought to make statues of 
		the gods genial and smiling, so that we may smile back at them rather 
		than be afraid of them” (<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>fr. </i>
		</font>19).</font><sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup></p>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="justify">As we have seen, Epicurus’ ethical theory, like his 
		physical theory, is based on the validity of sensation. Since our senses 
		inform us that pleasure is good and pain is bad, we should aim to 
		experience as much pleasure and as little pain as possible. But by no 
		means every pleasure is to be taken, and by no means every pain is to be 
		avoided, because pleasure (as anyone who drinks to excess can confirm) 
		sometimes leads to pain, and pain (as anyone who has endured the 
		dentist’s drill knows) sometimes leads to pleasure (<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Letter 
		to Menoeceus </i></font>129–130).</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">An important teaching is that pleasure is limited 
		(5.1433), and that the limit of bodily pleasure is reached as soon as 
		desire is satisfied and the pain of want is removed: after that pleasure 
		can only be varied, not increased (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Principal 
		Doctrines </i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">18). Important too is 
		the distinction made between kinetic pleasure (the pleasure of 
		movement), derived from the process of satisfying desire (for example, 
		eating to satisfy hunger), and katastematic or static pleasure (the 
		pleasure of equilibrium), which comes when desire is satisfied and the 
		pain of want has been removed. In sharp contrast to the hedonistic 
		philosophers of the Cyrenaic school, who favored the pursuit only of 
		kinetic pleasure and did not even recognize static pleasure as a 
		pleasure at all, Epicurus, though he did not ignore kinetic pleasure, 
		considered static pleasure to be much more desirable, partly because it 
		is more long lasting, partly because it is pain-free, whereas kinetic 
		pleasure, being derived from the process of satisfying desire, is 
		necessarily preceded by pain—the pain of unsatisfied desire.</p>
		</font>
        <p align="justify">Certainly the desires of the body, and therefore 
		kinetic pleasure, cannot be disregarded, but most bodily pleasure is 
		achieved not by leading a life of sensual indulgence, but by strictly 
		limiting one’s desires and eliminating all those that are incapable of 
		satisfaction and therefore bound to cause one pain. Desires are to be 
		separated into three classes: natural and necessary; natural but 
		unnecessary; neither natural nor necessary. The desires in the first 
		class, the desires for essential food, drink, clothing, and shelter, are 
		to be satisfied; those in the second class, including sexual desire, are 
		to be satisfied, if they cannot be suppressed, in strict moderation and 
		in the least disturbing way possible; and those in the third class, 
		including the desires for wealth and status, must be eliminated because 
		they can never be satisfied: they have no limit, so that one will always 
		suffer the pain of want as well as anxiety that one will lose what one 
		has acquired.</p><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="justify">Much more important than bodily pleasure is mental 
		pleasure. Whereas the body can feel pleasure only at the time of the 
		pleasurable experience, the mind has the gifts of memory and 
		anticipation: it can mitigate or eliminate present pain by the 
		recollection of past pleasures or the expectation of pleasures to come; 
		moreover, whereas the static pleasure of the body (freedom from pain) 
		cannot be enjoyed all the time, because it is bound to be interrupted by 
		the pain of physical want, it is possible, if one guides one’s life by 
		true principles, to experience without interruption the static pleasure 
		of the mind (freedom from disturbance). Although the mind’s ability to 
		look back and forward is exploited by the wise to their advantage, it 
		ruins the lives of those whose attitude to past events is bitter, and 
		whose attitude to the future is dominated by unnecessary fears, 
		especially of the gods and of death, and unnecessary and insatiable 
		desires, especially for wealth and power.</p>
		</font>
		<p align="justify">The Epicureans have often been criticized for their 
		hedonism and <font FACE="TimesNewRoman">egoism. But their doctrine of 
		pleasure turns out to be something much closer to asceticism than to 
		self-indulgence. It was no advocate of </font><i>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic">la dolce vita </font></i>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">who considered the addition of cheese to his 
		normal bread-and-water diet a luxury (Diogenes Laertius 10.11), and who 
		wrote to a friend concerning a young disciple, “If you wish to make 
		Pythocles rich, do not increase his means, but diminish his desire” (Usener
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>fr. </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">135). What of the charge of egoism? It is 
		true that individuals should aim to obtain as much pleasure for 
		themselves as possible. But, although virtue is the means to the end, 
		which is pleasure, true pleasure is impossible without virtue and is 
		also inseparable from friendship. The fact is that in Epicurean ethics, 
		egoism and altruism merge.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">Although Epicureanism did not offer its adherents a 
		life after death, it did offer them a heaven on earth. “You shall live 
		like a god among human beings,” writes Epicurus in </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Letter to Menoeceus </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">(135); Lucretius states that “there is 
		nothing to prevent us from living a life worthy of the gods” (3.322); 
		and Diogenes of Oinoanda looks forward to the time when “truly the life 
		of the gods will pass to human beings” (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>fr.
		</i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">56). These statements are to be 
		taken literally: thanks to Epicurus, it is possible to obtain on earth 
		the perfect tranquillity of mind and happiness that the gods enjoy out 
		in space. It is true that, whereas the gods are immortal, humans are 
		mortal, but perfect pleasure can be achieved in a limited time, and 
		extension of time, even to infinity, would not produce any greater 
		pleasure (</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Principal 
		Doctrines </i></font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">19–20), and what 
		Lucretius strikingly calls “deathless death” (3.869) is nothing to us—of 
		no more concern to us than the eternity of past time was to us before we 
		were born (3.830–842, 972–977).</p>

        structured.<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup>&nbsp;
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">The six books fall naturally into three 
		pairs. Books 1 and 2 deal with atoms and void, Book 1 establishing the 
		basic principles of atomism and Book 2 describing the movements, 
		properties, and combinations of the atoms. In Books 3 and 4 the focus is 
		on psychology: in Book 3 the material and mortal nature of the mind and 
		spirit is demonstrated, and the bulk of Book 4 is devoted to explanation 
		of sensation and thought. Books 5 and 6 are concerned with our world and 
		its phenomena—Book 5 with its mortality, formation, and development, 
		Book 6 with a variety of celestial and terrestrial phenomena.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">It is noticeable that in each pair it is the 
		odd-numbered book that presents the basic doctrines, whereas the 
		even-numbered one, though essential to Lucretius’ exposition of the 
		Epicurean system, presents deductions from those doctrines and arguments 
		that supplement and complement them. This pattern is certainly 
		deliberate, and one would like to know whether it influenced the design 
		of Virgil’s </font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>Aeneid, </i>
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">where dramatic books alternate with 
		less dramatic ones, though there it is the even-numbered books that 
		stand out in higher relief.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">There is not space to mention, let alone discuss, all 
		the structural features and patterns of Lucretius’ work, but it is 
		important to give some attention to the opening and concluding passages 
		of the books, not least because, as we shall see, consideration of them 
		is relevant to the question of whether the poet is, as some think, a 
		pessimist.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">Each book has a carefully written preface. The 
		preface to Book 1, which serves also as the preface to the whole poem, 
		is the longest. Its sections include the opening invocation to Venus 
		(1–43), praise of Epicurus as the moral savior of humanity (62–79), and 
		disclosure of the philosopher-poet’s pioneering and difficult task 
		(136–145). The opening passages of the other five books develop themes 
		of the first preface. Proud proclamation of the writer’s mission is 
		elaborated in the preface to Book 4.31 Praise of Epicurus’ achievement 
		is repeated and expanded in the prefaces to Books 3, 5, and 6; and 
		although the preface to Book 2 does not mention Epicurus, its theme is 
		the indispensability of his philosophy. In no preface is there a trace 
		of pessimism: in each passage Lucretius makes clear that, while those 
		ignorant of Epicurean philosophy lead unsatisfactory and unhappy lives, 
		those who embrace it find happiness. The message is consistently one of 
		hope and optimism.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">No book of the poem has a concluding passage, such as 
		a modern scientific writer might provide, in which a final opinion, 
		based on the preceding arguments, is presented. It is important to bear 
		this point in mind, especially in connection with the concluding passage 
		of the poem, which some have seen as evidence of Lucretius’ pessimism 
		and final despair. I shall return to this shortly.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">The concluding sections of the books, like the books 
		to which they belong, are paired.32 Book 1 ends, if one disregards the 
		last four lines (1114–1117), in which the poet addresses words of 
		encouragement to Memmius, with proof of the infinity of the universe 
		(951–1113), Book 2 with proof of the infinite number of worlds that the 
		infinite universe contains (1023–1174). In the closing sections of Books 
		3 and 4 Lucretius brilliantly deploys his poetical genius, his command 
		of rhetoric, his satirical power, and his missionary fervor to deliver 
		with maximum effect physics-based ethical messages: the passage in Book 
		3 (830–1094) is concerned with an unnecessary fear—fear of death; the 
		passage in Book 4 (1058–1287) deals predominantly with an unnecessary 
		desire—sexual desire. In the third pair of books the relationship 
		between the final sections is less obvious than in the other two pairs, 
		but is very real and very important. In order to understand it properly, 
		we must take account of what Lucretius says in the preface to Book 6, a 
		passage that (appropriately, in view of the close links between Books 5 
		and 6) has many similarities to the preface of Book 5.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">Book 5 ends with an account of the development of 
		civilization (1011–1457)—an account that makes clear that, while human 
		beings were very successful in mastering their natural environment and 
		in making technical and cultural advances, they were not so successful 
		in mastering themselves: whereas primitive humans usually managed to 
		satisfy their natural and necessary desires for food, drink, and 
		shelter, “civilized” humans are too often disturbed by unnatural and 
		unnecessary desires as well as by unnecessary fears. In the opening 
		passage of Book 6 (1–42), which begins with mention of Athens, the place 
		where cultural development reached “the peak of perfection” reported in 
		the last line of Book 5, Lucretius describes how Epicurus, a citizen of 
		Athens, correctly diagnosed the causes of the moral sickness from which 
		people were suffering: he saw that they had all the things apparently 
		necessary for a good life, but that they were unhappy because they did 
		not understand the limits of fear and desire and did not know how to 
		cope morally with situations of adversity.</p>
		<p ALIGN="justify">This passage, with its mention of Athens and its 
		emphasis on moral sickness and health, not only looks back to the 
		closing section of Book 5, but also looks forward to the closing section 
		of Book 6 (1138–1286), an account, modeled on that of Thucydides 
		(2.47–52), of the terrible plague of Athens in 430 </font>
		<span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span><font FACE="Times-RomanSC">
		</font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman">Lucretius represents the plague not 
		only as a physical calamity, but also as a moral one: the 
		plague-stricken Athenians, living before Epicurus’ remedies were 
		available, were philosophically, as well as medically, unequipped to 
		deal with this situation of extreme adversity. There is the further 
		point that the Epicureans were fond of representing the unenlightened as 
		diseased or plague-stricken (see, for example, Cicero </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>De Finibus </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">1.59; Diogenes of Oinoanda </font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman-Italic"><i>fr. </i></font>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">3), and there can be little doubt that the 
		condition of the plague’s victims </font>symbolizes for Lucretius the moral condition of those 
        ignorant of Epicurean philosophy.<sup><a href="#33">33</a></sup></p>
		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
		<p ALIGN="LEFT">So the account of the plague does not reflect the poet’s 
		pessimism and despair. Rather “the prospect of salvation and of a heaven 
		on earth which Lucretius offers . . . shines with a brighter and 
		stronger light on account of this dark and hellish picture of what life 
		is like without the guidance of Epicurus.”</font><sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup></p>

		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="2">Acheron, strictly a river of the 
		underworld, is often used by Lucretius, Virgil, and others, to mean the 
		underworld itself. As I point out in the Loeb edition xx–xxi, it is 
		inconceivable that Virgil could have written the lines quoted, if he had 
		known that Lucretius had gone mad and committed suicide, for “it would 
		have been a sarcastic and cruel comment on a man whose tragic end showed 
		that he was anything but </font>

		<font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="2">The Stoic school, which was to be

		Empire, derived its name from the Painted Stoa, a colonnaded building in 
		the Athenian Agora where Zeno taught. We do not hear of any hostility 
		between Epicurus and Zeno, but it is difficult to imagine that they 
		approved of one another’s views. Although Lucretius never mentions the 
		Stoics by name, those scholars who have recently argued that he never 
		has them in mind are almost certainly mistaken. See notes on 1.638; 
		4.823–857; 5.22, 110–234, 156–173, 200–203.</p></font>
