        Zeus
has called to order a meeting of the
gods, in order to make them aware of an impending crisis&#133;
      
        <font size="2">
<hr width="100%"><p align="justify"><b><font SIZE="+1">Z</font>EUS</b> </p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Gentlemen of Heaven,
</p>

<p align="justify"><img border="0" src="zeus.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" alt="Zeus" width="327" height="448">In preference to great riches, I am sure you would
choose to learn why it is that you are now assembled. This being so, it
behooves you to give my words an attentive hearing. The present crisis,
gods, all but breaks out in speech and says that we must grapple stoutly
with the issues of the day, but we, it seems to me, are treating them with
great indifference. I now desire&#151;my Demosthenes is running short, you see&#151;to
tell you plainly what it was the disturbed me and made me call the meeting.
</p>

<p align="justify">Yesterday, as you know, when Mnesitheus the ship-captain made the offering
for the deliverance of his ship, which came near being lost off Caphereus,
we banqueted at Piraeus, those of us whom Mnesitheus asked to the sacrifice.
Then after libations, you all went in different directions, wherever each
of you thought fit, but I myself, as it was not very late, went up to town
to take my evening stroll in the Potter&#146;s Quarter, reflecting as I went
upon the stinginess of Mnesitheus. To feast sixteen gods he had sacrificed
only a cock, and a wheezy old cock at that, and four little cakes of frankincense
that were thoroughly well mildewed, so that they went right out on the
coals and didn&#146;t even give off enough smoke to smell with the tip of you
nose; and yet he had promised whole herds of cattle while the ship was
drifting on the rock and was inside the ledges. </p>

<p align="justify">But when, thus reflecting, I had reached the Painted Porch, I saw a
great number of men gathered together, some inside, in the porch itself,
a number in the court, and one or two sitting on the seats bawling and
straining their lungs. Guessing (as was indeed the case) that they were
philosophers of the disputatious order, I decided to stop and hear what
they were saying, and as I happened to be wrapped in one of my thick clouds,
I dressed myself after their style and lengthened my beard with a pull,
making myself very much like a philosopher; then elbowing the rabble aside,
I went in without being recognized. I found the Epicurean Damis, that sly
rogue, and Timocles the Stoic, the best man in the world, disputing madly:
at least Timocles was sweating and had worn his voice out with shouting,
while Damis with his sardonic laughter was making him more and more excited.
</p>

<p align="justify">Their whole discussion was about us. That confounded Damis asserted
that we do not exercise any providence on behalf of men and do not oversee
what goes on among them, saying nothing less than that we do not exist
at all (for that is of course what his argument implied), and there were
some who applauded him. The other, however, I mean Timocles, was on our
side and fought for us and got angry and took our part in every way, praising
our management and telling how we govern and direct everything in the appropriate
order and system; and he too had some who applauded him. But finally he
grew tired and began to speak badly and the crowd began to turn admiring
eyes on Damis; so, seeing the danger, I ordered night to close in and break
up the conference. They went away, therefore, after agreeing to carry the
dispute to a conclusion the next day, and I myself, going along with the
crowd, overheard them praising Damis&#146; views on their way home and even
then far preferring his side: there were some, however, who recommended
them not to condemn the other side in advance but to wait and see what
Timocles would say the next day. </p>

<p align="justify">That is why I called you together, gods, and it is no trivial reason
if you consider that all our honor and glory and revenue comes from men,
and if they are convinced either that there are no gods at all or that
if there are they have no thought of men, we shall be without sacrifices,
without presents, and without honors on earth and shall sit idle in Heaven
in the grip of famine, choused out of our old-time feasts and celebrations
and games and sacrifices and vigils and processions. Such being the issue,
I say that all must try to think out something to save the situation for
us, so that Timocles will win and be thought to have the truth on his side
of the argument and Damis will be laughed to scorn by the audience: for
I have very little confidence that Timocles will win by himself if he has
not our backing. Therefore make you lawful proclamation, Hermes, so that
they may arise and give counsel. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">H</font>ERMES </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Hark! Hush! No noise! Who of the gods in full standing that have the
right to speak wants to do so? What&#146;s this? Nobody arises? Are you dumfounded
by the greatness of the issues presented, that you hold your tongues? </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">M</font>OMUS </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">&quot;Marry, you others may all into water and earth be converted&quot;;
<a HREF="Zeus.html#1"><sup>*</sup></a> but as for me, if I were privileged to speak frankly, I would have a
great deal to say. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">Z</font>EUS </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Speak, Momus, with full confidence, for it is clear that your frankness
will be indebted for our common good. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">M</font>OMUS </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Well then, listen, gods, to what comes straight from the heart, as the
saying goes. I quite expected that we should wind up in this helpless plight
and that we should have a great crop of sophists like this, who get form
us ourselves the justification for their temerity; and I vow by Themis
that it is not right to be angry at Epicurus or at his associates and successors
in doctrine if they have formed such an idea of us. Why, what could one
expect them to think when they see so much confusion in life, and see that
the good men among them are neglected and waste away in poverty and illness
and bondage while scoundrelly, pestilential fellows are highly honored
and have enormous wealth and lord it over their betters, and that temple-robbers
are not punished but escape, while men who are guiltless of all wrong-doing
sometimes dies by the cross or the scourge? </p>

<p align="justify">It is natural, then, that on seeing this they think of us as if we were
nothing at all, especially when they hear the oracles saying that on crossing
the Halys somebody will destroy a great kingdom, without indicating whether
he will destroy his own or that of the enemy; and again </p>

        <blockquote>

<p align="justify">&quot;Glorious Salamis, death shalt thou bring to the children of women,&quot;
<a HREF="#2"><sup>**</sup></a> </p>

        </blockquote>

<p align="justify">for surely both the Persians and Greeks were the children of women!
And when the reciters tell them that we fall in love and get wounded and
are thrown into chains and become slaves and quarrel among ourselves and
have a thousand cares, and all this in spite of our claim to be blissful
and deathless, are they not justified in laughing at us and holding us
in no esteem? We, however, are vexed if any humans not wholly without wits
criticize all this and reject our providence, when we ought to be glad
if any of them continue to sacrifice to us, offending as we do. </p>

<p align="justify">I beg you here and now, Zeus, as we are alone and there is no man in
our gathering&#150;except Heracles and Dionysus and Ganymede and Asclepius,
who are naturalized aliens&#151;answer me truly, have you ever had enough regard
for those on earth to find out who are the good among them and who are
the bad? No you can&#146;t say that you have! In fact, if Theseus on his way
from Troezen to Athens had not incidentally done away with the marauders,
as far as you and your providence are concerned nothing would hinder Sciron
and Pityocamptes and Cercyon and the rest of them from continuing to live
in luxury by slaughtering wayfarers. And if Eurystheus, an upright man,
full of providence, had not out of the love he bore his fellow men looked
into the conditions everywhere and sent out this servant of his,<a HREF="Zeus.html#3"><sup>***</sup></a>
a hardworking fellow eager for tasks, you, Zeus, would have paid little
heed to the Hydra and the Stymphalian birds and the Thracian mares and
the insolence and wantonness of the Centaurs. </p>

<p align="justify">If you would have me speak the truth, we sit here considering just one
question, whether anybody is slaying victims and burning incense at our
altars; everything else drifts with the current, swept aimlessly along.
Therefore we are getting and shall continue to get no more than we deserve
when men gradually begin to crane their necks upward and find out that
it does them no good to sacrifice to us and hold processions. Then in a
little while you shall see the Epicuruses and Metrodoruses and Damises
laughing at us, and our pleaders overpowered and silenced by them. So it
is for the rest of you to check and remedy all this, you who have brought
things to this pass. To me, being only Momus, it does not make much difference
if I am to be unhonored, for even in bygone days I was not one of those
in honor, while you are still fortunate and enjoy your sacrifices. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">Z</font>EUS</b> </p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Let us ignore this fellow&#146;s nonsense, gods; he is always harsh and fault-finding.
As that wonderful man Demosthenes says, to reproach and criticize and find
fault is easy and anyone can do it, but to advise how a situation may be
improved requires a really wise counselor; and this is what the rest of
you will do, I am very sure, even if Momus says nothing. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">P</font>OSEIDON </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">For my part I am pretty much subaqueous, as you know, and live by myself
in the depths, doing my best to rescue sailors, speed vessels on their
course, and calm the winds. Nevertheless I am interested in matters here
too, and I say that this Damis should be put out of the way before he enters
the dispute, wither with a thunderbolt or by some other means, for fear
that he may get the better of it in the argument; for you ay, Zeus, that
he is a plausible fellow. At the same time we&#146;ll show them how we punish
people who way such things against us. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">Z</font>EUS </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Are you joking, Poseidon, or have you completely forgotten that nothing
of the sort is in our power, but the Fates decide by their spinning that
one man is to die by a thunderbolt, another by the sword and another by
fever or consumption? If it lay in my power, do you suppose I would have
let the temple-robbers get away from Olympia the other day unscathed by
my thunderbolt, when they had shorn off two of my curls weighing six pounds
apiece? Or would you yourself at Geraestus have allowed the fisherman from
Oreus to filch you trident? Besides, it will look as if we were getting
angry because we have been injured, and as if we feared the arguments of
Damis and were making away with him for that reason, without waiting for
him to be put to the proof by Timocles. Shall we not seem, then, to be
winning by default if we win in that way? </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">P</font>OSEIDON </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Why, I supposed I had thought of a shortcut to victory! </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">Z</font>EUS </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Avast! A stockfish idea, Poseidon, downright stupid, to make away with
your adversary in advance so that he may die undefeated, leaving the question
still in dispute and unsettled! </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">A</font>POLLO </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">If we young fellows without beards were permitted by law to take the
floor, perhaps I might have made some useful contribution to the debate.
</p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">M</font>OMUS </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">In the first place, Apollo, the debate is on such great issues that
the right to speak does not go by age but is open to all alike; for it
would be delicious if when we were in direst danger we quibbled about our
rights under the law. Secondly, according to law you are already fully
entitled to floor, for you came of age long ago and are registered in the
list of the Twelve Gods and almost were a member of the council in the
days of Cronus. So don&#146;t play the boy with us: say what you think boldly,
and don&#146;t be sensitive about speaking without a beard when you have such
a long-bearded, hairy-faced son in Asclepius. Besides, it would be in order
for you to show your wisdom now or never, unless you sit on Helicon and
talk philosophy with the Muses for nothing. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">A</font>POLLO </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">But it is not for you to give such permission, Momus; it is for Zeus,
and if he lets me perhaps I may say something not without sweetness and
light and worthy of my study on Helicon. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">Z</font>EUS </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Speak, my boy: I give you permission. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">A</font>POLLO</b> </p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">This Timocles is an upright, god-fearing man and he is thoroughly up
in the Stoic doctrines, so that he gives lessons to many of the young men
and collects large fees for it, being very plausible when he disputes privately
with his pupils; but he utterly lacks the courage to speak before a crowd
and his language is vulgar and half-foreign, so that he gets laughed at
for that reason when he appears in public, for he does not talk fluently
but stammers and gets confused, especially when in spite of these faults
he wants to make a show of fine language. His intellect, to be sure, is
exceedingly keen and subtle, as people say who know more then I about Stoicism,
but in lecturing and expounding he weakens and obscures his points by his
incapacity, not making his meaning clear but presenting propositions that
are like riddles and returning answers that are still more unintelligible;
hence the others failing to comprehend, laugh at him. But it is essential
to speak clearly, I think, and beyond all else to take great pains to be
understood by the hearers. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">M</font>OMUS </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">You were right, Apollo, in praising people who speak clearly, even though
you yourself do not do it at all, for in your oracles you are ambiguous
and riddling and you unconcernedly toss most of them into the debatable
ground so that your hearers need another Apollo to interpret them. But
what do you advise as the next step, what remedy for Timocles&#146; helplessness
in debate? </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">A</font>POLLO </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">To give him a spokesman, if possible, Momus, one of those eloquent chaps
who will say fittingly whatever Timocles thinks of and suggests. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">M</font>OMUS </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Truly a puerile suggestion which shows that you still need a tutor,
that we should bring a spokesman into a meeting of philosophers to interpret
the opinions of Timocles to the company, and that Damis should speak in
his own person and unaided while the other, making use of a proxy, privately
whispers his ideas into his ear and the proxy does the speaking, perhaps
without even understanding what he hears; wouldn&#146;t that be fun for the
crowd! No, let&#146;s think of some other way to manage this thing. But as for
you, my admirable friend, since you claim to be a prophet and have collected
large fees for such work, even to the extent of getting ingots of gold
once upon a time, why do you not give us a timely display of you skill
by foretelling which of the sophists will win in the argument? Of course
you know what the outcome will be, if you are a prophet. </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">A</font>POLLO </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">How can I do that, Momus, when we have no tripod here, and no incense
or prophetic spring like Castaly? </p>

        <font size="2">
      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">M</font>OMUS </b></p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">There now! You dodge the test when it comes to the pinch. </p>

        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Speak up, my boy, all the same, and don&#146;t give this slanderer an chance
to malign and insult your profession by saying that it all depends on a
tripod and water and incense, so that if you didn&#146;t have those things you
would be deprived of your skill. </p>

        </font>
      
<p align="justify">It would be better, father, to do such business at Delphi or Colophon
where I have all the necessaries at hand, in the usual way. However, even
thus devoid of them and unequipped, I will try to foretell whose the victory
shall be: you will bear with me if my verses are lame. </p>

        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Do speak; but let it be clear, and not itself in need of spokesman or
an interpreter. It is not now a question of lamb and turtle cooking together
in Lydia, but you know what the debate is about. </p>

<p align="justify">What in the world are you going to say, my boy? These preliminaries
to your oracle are terrifying in themselves; you color is changed, your
eyes are rolling, your hair stands on end, your movements are frenzied,
and in a word everything about you suggests demoniacal possession and gooseflesh
and mysteries. </p>

Touching the shivery strife in which heroes are facing each other. <br>
Loudly they shout in the battle, and fast-flying words are their weapons;
<br>
Many a blow while the hisses of conflict are ebbing and flowing <br>
This way and that shall be dealt on the crest of the plowtail stubborn;
<br>
Yet when the hook-taloned vulture the grasshopper grips in his clutches,

then shall the rainbearing crows make an end of their cawing forever: <br>
Victory shall go to the mules, and the ass will rejoice in his offspring!

of the gods. </p>

        </font>
      
<p align="justify">But, my admirable friend, everybody will agree with you that Homer is
a good poet, to be sure, but not that he or any other poet whatsoever is
a truthful witness in regard to such things. They do not pay any heed to
truth, I take it, but only to charming their hearers, and to this end they
enchant them with meters and entrance them with fables and in a word do
anything to give pleasure. However, I should like to know what it was of
Homer&#146;s that convinced you most. What he says about Zeus, how his daughter
and his brother and his wife made a plot to fetter him? If Thetis had not
summoned Briareus, our excellent Zeus would have been caught and put in
chains. For this he returned thanks to Thetis by deceiving Agamemnon, sending
a false vision to him, in order that many of the Achaeans might lose their
lives. Don&#146;t you see, it was impossible for him to hurl a thunderbolt and
burn up Agamemnon himself without making himself out a liar? Or perhaps
you were most inclined to believe when you heard how Diomed wounded Aphrodite
and then even Ares himself at the suggestion of Athena, and how shortly
afterwards the gods themselves fell to and began dueling promiscuously,
males and females; Athena defeated Ares, already overtaxed, no doubt by
the wound he had received from Diomed, and </p>

<ul>
<p align="justify">&quot;Leto fought against Hermes, the stalwart god of good fortune.&quot;
</p>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Or perhaps you thought the tale about Artemis credible, that, being
a fault-finding person, who got angry when she was not invited to a feast
by Oeneus and so turned loose on his land a monstrous boar of irresistible
strength. Did Homer convince you by saying that sort of thing? </p>

<p align="justify">I suppose you don&#146;t think that Euripides is telling the truth either,

heroes and destroying villains and impious fellows like yourself? </p>

<p align="justify">Why Timocles, you doughtiest of philosophers, if the playwrights have
convinced you by doing this, you must believe either that Polus and Aristodemus
and Satyrus are gods for the nonce, or that the very masks representing
the gods, the buskins, the trailing tunics, the cloaks, gauntlets, padded
paunches and all the other things with which they make tragedy grand are
divine; and that is thoroughly ridiculous. I assure you when Euripides,
following his own devices, says what he thinks without being under any
constraint imposed by the requirements of his plays, you will her him speaking
frankly then: </p>

<p align="justify">Thank you kindly, Timocles, for reminding me of what the nations believe.
From that you can discern particularly well that there is no certainty
in the theory of gods, for the confusion is great, and some believe one
thing, some another. The Scythians offer sacrifice to a scimitar, the Thracians
to Zamolxis, a runaway slave who came to them from Sámos, the Phrygians
to Men, the Ethiopians to Day, the Cyllenians to Phales, the Assyrians
to a dove, the Persians to fire, and the Egyptians to water. And while
all the Egyptians in common have water for a god, the people of Memphis
have the bull, the people of Pelusium a wild onion, others an ibis or a
crocodile, others a dog-faced god or a cat or a monkey. Moreover, taking
them by villages, some hold the right shoulder a god and others, who dwell
opposite them, the left; others, half a skull, and others an earthen cup
or dish. Isn&#146;t that matter for laughter, good Timocles? </p>

tell us a different tale, that a grave is painted out there with a tombstone

striking the main canvas and filling the other sails, or else by the rowers,

safe? </p>

steered, this universe keeps in motion unsteered and unofficered? </p>

<p align="justify">Good! Timocles put that very shrewdly, with a valid illustration. </p>

      <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: -15"><b><font SIZE="+1">D</font>AMIS</b> </p>
        </font>
      
<p align="justify">Why, Timocles, you superlative admirer of the gods, in the one case
you would have seen the captain always planning what had better be done
and making ready beforehand and giving orders to the crew, and the ship
would contain nothing at all that was profitless and senseless, that was
not wholly useful and necessary to them for their voyage. But in the other
case your captain, the one who, you say, is in command of this great ship,
manages nothing in a sensible or fitting way, and neither do the members
of his crew; the forestay is carried aft, maybe, and both the sheets forward,
the anchors are sometimes of gold while the figurehead is of lead, and
all the ship&#146;s underbody in painted while her upper works are unsightly.
Among the sailors themselves you will see that one who is lazy and lubberly
and has no heart for his work, has a warrant or even a commission, while
another who is fearless at diving and handy in manning the yards and best
acquainted with everything that needs to be done, is set to pumping ship.
So too with the passengers: you&#146;ll see some gallows-bird or other sitting
on the quarter deck beside the captain and receiving attentions, and another,
a profligate, a parricide, or a temple-robber, getting inordinate honor
and taking up the whole deck of the ship, while a lot of good fellows are
crowded into a corner of the hold and trampled on by men who are really
their inferiors. Just think, for example, what a voyage Socrates, Aristides,
and Phocion had, without biscuits enough to eat and without even room to
stretch their legs on the bare boards alongside the bilgewater, and on
the other hand what favors Callias and Midias and Sardanapalus enjoyed,
rolling in luxury and spitting on those beneath them! </p>

<p align="justify">That is what goes on in your ship, Timocles, you greatest of sages,
and that is why the disasters are countless. But if there were really a
captain in command who saw and directed everything, first of all he would
not have failed to know who ere the good and who ere the bad among the
men aboard, and secondly he would have given each man his due according
to his worth, giving to the better men the better quarters beside him on
deck and to the worse the quarters in the hold; some of them he would have
made his messmates and advisers, and as for the crew, a zealous man would
have been assigned to command forward or in the waist, or at any rate somewhere
or other over the heads of the rest, while a timorous, shiftless one would
get clouted over the head half a dozen times a day with the rope&#146;s end.
Consequently, my interesting friend, your comparison of the ship would
seem to have capsized for the want of a good captain. </p>
