son of Neocles and Chaerestrate, was an Athenian from the district of Gargettus 
district, of 
the Philaidae clan, as Metrodorus reports in his book <i>On Noble Birth</i>.&nbsp; 
Other sources, including Heraclides in his <i>Epitome</i> of Sotion, report that 
he grew up in Samos, after the Athenians divided up the land for colonization, 
and he came to Athens at age eighteen, when Xenocrates lectured at the Academy, 
and Aristotle in Chalcis.&nbsp; But when Alexander of Macedon died, and the 
Athenians at Samos were evicted by Perdiccas, Epicurus left Athens to join 
his father in Colophon.&nbsp; He stayed there for some time and gathered disciples, then 
returned to Athens during the archonship of Anaxicrates {307-306 BCE}.&nbsp; For 
a while, he continued practicing philosophy with other philosophers, but 
afterwards he eventually founded the philosophical sect which bears his name.<p align="justify">He first encountered philosophy, as he himself says, at the age of fourteen.&nbsp; Apollodorus the Epicurean, in the first book of his <i>Life of Epicurus</i>, 
reports that he turned to philosophy out of disgust with his schoolmasters, 
because they could not explain to him the meaning of <i>chaos</i> in Hesiod.<br>

<p align="justify">But all these people are devoid of sense.&nbsp; The 
preponderance 
of witnesses speak of the insuperable kindness of our philosopher to everyone, 
whether it be to his own country who honored him with bronze statues, his 
friends who are so numerous that they could not be counted in whole cities, or 
all his acquaintances who were bound to him simply by the appeal of his 
doctrines.&nbsp; None deserted him, except Metrodorus, the son of Stratoniceus, who went over to Carneades, 
probably because he could not stand Epicurus’ unapproachable excellence.&nbsp; The 
school itself, while every other school has declined, has continued in 
perpetuity through an uninterrupted succession of head-philosophers. We may also 
note his gratitude towards his parents, his generosity to his brothers, and his 
kindness to his servants (as made plain by his will, and also from the fact that 
they joined him in his philosophical pursuits, the most eminent of them being 
the aforementioned Mys), and his universal philanthropy towards all men.<br>

piety towards the gods and his love for his country are beyond words.&nbsp; His 
deference to others was so keen that he did not bother to enter public life.&nbsp; 
And although he lived while very difficult times oppressed Greece, he still 
remained in his own country, only venturing two or three times out to Ionia to 
visit his friends, who used to throng to him from all quarters to live with 
him in his garden, as we are told by Apollodorus (This
garden he bought for eighty minae).&nbsp; And Diocles, in his third <i>Epitome,</i> 
says that they all lived in the most simple and economical manner; “They were 
content,” he says, “with a small cup of light wine, or just drank only 
water.” He also tells us that Epicurus forbade his companions from holding 
property in common, unlike Pythagoras, who required it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Such a 
practice, in his opinion, implied mistrust – and without trust there is no 
friendship.&nbsp; And in his letters, he himself says that he is content with 
water and plain bread, adding, “Send me some Cytherean cheese, so that if I wish 
to have a feast, I may have the means.”<br>

disciples, the most famous being Metrodorus of Lampsacus, son of Athenaeus (or 
Timocrates) and Sande.&nbsp; From the time they first met, he never left him, 
except once when he went home for six months, but then returned to him.&nbsp; 
And he was a virtuous man in every respect, as Epicurus tells us in prefatory 
dedications in his works, and in the third book of his <i>Timocrates</i>.&nbsp; 
Being of such character, he gave his sister Bates in marriage to Idomeneus, 
while he himself took Leontium, the Attic courtesan, for his concubine.&nbsp; He 
bared all disturbances, and even death, without fear; Epicurus tells us so in 
his first book on <i>Metrodorus</i>.&nbsp; He reportedly died seven years before 
Epicurus himself, in the fifty-third year of his life.&nbsp; In the 
aforementioned will, Epicurus stipulates many provisions about the guardianship 
of his children <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">–
</span>an indication that he had been dead some time.&nbsp; His brother was also 
a pupil of Epicurus, the aforementioned Timocrates&nbsp;

        The Canon</i>.&nbsp; Physics consists of a comprehensive theory of nature; it is 
found in the thirty-seven books <i>On Nature</i> and is also summarized among his <i>Letters</i>.&nbsp; Ethics, finally, deals with choice and avoidance, 
which may be found 
        in the books <i>On Lifecourses</i>, among his <i>Letters</i>, and in the book <i>
On the End-Goal</i>.&nbsp; Canonics and Physics are usually treated 
jointly.&nbsp; The former defines the criterion of truth and discusses first 
principles (the elementary part of philosophy), while the latter deals with the 
creation and destruction of things in nature.&nbsp; Ethics counsels upon things 
chosen versus those avoided, the art of living, and the <i>end-goal</i>.&nbsp; Dialectics they 
dismiss as superfluous<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;–

for <i>opinion.</i>&nbsp; An opinion may be true or false.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
True opinions are confirmed and uncontradicted {by the testimony of sensations}; 
false opinions are unconfirmed and contradicted {by the testimony of

physics.&nbsp; Even those who have thoroughly learned the entire system must be

something that brings no trouble when it arrives.&nbsp; So death, the most dreaded of

<p align="justify">He further disagrees with the Cyrenaics in that they consider 
the pains of the body to be worse than troubles in the mind by arguing that 
those who do wrong, are bodily punished.&nbsp; Nonetheless, he considers the 
troubles of the mind the worst, because the body only feels a present 
affliction, but the mind feels the past, the present, and the future. 
Conversely, he contends also that the pleasures of the mind are greater than 
those of the body.</p>
<p align="justify">He cites as proof that pleasure is the chief good the fact 
that all animals from the moment of their birth are delighted with pleasure and 
distressed by pain by their natural instincts, without need of reason.&nbsp; 
Therefore also, we, with our own inclinations, flee from pain; so that Hercules, 
when devoured by his poisoned tunic cries out: </p>
