<p align="center"><i>The four-fold cure for anxiety:<br>
Don't fear the gods;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor death;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goods are easy to obtain; &nbsp; 
Evils are easy to endure</i></p>
        <p align="justify"><a NAME="I"></a><b>1)</b>&nbsp; A blessed and imperishable 
        being neither has trouble itself nor does it cause trouble for anyone 
        else; therefore, it does not experience feelings of anger or 
        indebtedness, for such feelings 
        signify weakness.</p>
<p align="justify"><a NAME="II"></a><b>2)</b>&nbsp; Death is nothing to us, 
because a body that has been dispersed
into elements experiences no sensations, and the absence of sensation is nothing to us.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="III"></a><b>3)</b>&nbsp; Pleasure reaches its maximum 
limit at the removal
of all sources of pain. When such pleasure is present, for as long as it lasts, there is no 
cause of physical nor mental pain present <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">–
</span>nor of both together.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="IV"></a><b>4)&nbsp; </b>Continuous physical 
pain does not last long.&nbsp; Instead, extreme pain lasts only a very short time, and even 
less-extreme pain does not last for many days at once.&nbsp; Even protracted diseases 
allow periods of physical comfort that exceed feelings of pain.</p>
        <p align="center"><i>Pleasure and virtue are interdependent</i></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="V"></a><b>5)</b>&nbsp; It is impossible to live 
pleasantly without living
wisely and honorably and justly, and it is impossible to live wisely and honorably and
justly without living pleasantly. Whenever any one of these is lacking (when, for
instance, one is not able to live wisely, though he lives honorably and justly) it is
impossible for him to live a pleasant life.</p>
        <p align="center"><i>Social and financial status have recognizable costs 
        and benefits</i></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="VI"></a><b>6)</b>&nbsp; That natural benefit of kingship and high office 
is (and only is) the degree to which they provide security from other men.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="VII"></a><b>7)&nbsp; </b>Some seek fame and 
status, thinking that they could thereby protect themselves against other men. If 
their lives really are secure,
then they have attained a natural good; if, however, they're insecure, they 
still lack what they originally sought by natural instinct.</p>
        <p align="justify"><a NAME="VIII"></a><b>8)</b>&nbsp; No pleasure is a 
        bad thing in itself, but some pleasures are only obtainable at the cost 
        of excessive troubles.</p>
        <p align="center"><i>Through the study of Nature, we discern the limits 
        of things</i></p>

        <p align="justify"><a NAME="IX"></a><b>9)&nbsp;</b> If every pleasure 
        could be prolonged to endure in both body or mind, pleasures 
        would never differ from one another.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="X"></a><b>10)&nbsp;</b> If the things which 
debauched men find pleasurable put an end to all fears (such as concerns about 
the heavenly bodies, death, and pain) and if they revealed how we ought to limit 
our desires, we would have no reason to reproach them, for they would be 
fulfilled with pleasures from every source while experiencing no pain, neither 
in mind nor body, which is the chief evil of life.</p>

        <p align="justify"><a NAME="XI"></a><b>11)&nbsp;</b> If we were never 
        troubled by how phenomena in the sky or death might concern us, or by 
        our failures to grasp the limits of pains and desires, we would have no 
        need to study nature.</p>
        <p align="justify"><a NAME="XII"></a><b>12)</b>&nbsp; One cannot rid 
        himself of his primal fears if he does not understand the nature of the 
        universe but instead suspects the truth of some mythical story. &nbsp;So 
        without the study of nature, there can be no enjoyment of pure pleasure.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XIII"></a><b>13)</b>&nbsp; One gains nothing by 
securing protection from other men if he still has apprehensions about things 
above and beneath the earth and throughout the infinite universe.</p>
        <p align="center"><i>Unlike social and financial status, which are 
        unlimited,<br>
        Peace of mind can be wholly secured</i></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XIV"></a><b>14)&nbsp;</b> Supreme power and great wealth may, 
to some degree, protect us from other men; but security in general depends upon peace of mind and 
social detachment.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XV"></a><b>15)&nbsp; </b>Natural wealth is both limited and easily obtained, but vanity 
is insatiable.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XVI"></a><b>16)</b>&nbsp; Chance has little effect 
upon the wise man, for his
greatest and highest interests are directed by reason throughout the course of life.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XVII"></a><b>17)</b>&nbsp; The just man is the freest of 
anyone from 
anxiety;
but the unjust man is perpetually haunted by it.</p>
        <p align="justify"><a NAME="XVIII"></a><b>18)&nbsp; </b>When pain 
        arising from need has been removed, bodily pleasure cannot increase – it 
        merely varies. But the limit of mental pleasure is reached after we 
        reflect upon these bodily pleasures and the related mental distress 
        prior to fulfillment.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XIX"></a><b>19)&nbsp; </b>Infinite and finite time 
afford equal pleasure, if
one measures its limits by reason.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XX"></a><b>20)</b>&nbsp; Bodily pleasure seems 
unlimited, and to provide it would require unlimited time. But the mind, 
recognizing the limits of the body, and dismissing apprehensions about eternity, 
furnishes a complete and optimal life, so we no longer have any need of 
unlimited time. Nevertheless, the mind does not shun pleasure; moreover, when 
the end of life approaches, it does not feel remorse, as if it fell short in any 
way from living the best life possible.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXI"></a><b>21)&nbsp;</b> He who understands the 
limits of life knows that things which remove pain arising from need are easy to 
obtain, and furnish a complete and optimal life. Thus he no longer needs things 
that are troublesome to attain.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Happiness depends on foresight and friendship</i></p>
        <p align="justify"><a NAME="XXII"></a><b>22)</b>&nbsp; We must consider 
        the ultimate goal to be real, and reconcile our opinions with sensory 
        experience; otherwise, life will be full of confusion 
        and disturbance.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXIII"></a><b>23)</b>&nbsp; If you argue against all 
your sensations, you will then have no criterion to declare any of them false.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXIV"></a><b>24)&nbsp;</b>If you arbitrarily reject 
any one sensory experience and fail to differentiate between an opinion awaiting 
confirmation and what is already perceived by the senses, feelings, and every 
intuitive faculty of mind, you will impute trouble to all other sensory 
experiences, thereby rejecting every criterion.&nbsp; And if you concurrently affirm 
what awaits confirmation as well as actual sensory experience, you will still 
blunder, because you will foster equal reasons to doubt the truth and falsehood 
of everything.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXV"></a><b>25)&nbsp;</b> If you do not reconcile 
your behavior with the goal of nature, but instead use some other criterion in 
matters of choice and avoidance, then there will be a conflict between theory 
and practice.</p>
        <p align="justify"><a NAME="XXVI"></a><b>26)</b>&nbsp; All desires which 
        create no pain when unfulfilled are not necessary; such desires may 
        easily be dispelled when they are seen as difficult to fulfill or likely 
        to produce harm.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXVII"></a><b>27)</b>&nbsp; Of all things that wisdom provides for living
one&#146;s entire life in happiness, the greatest by far is the possession of friendship.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXVIII"></a><b>28)</b>&nbsp; The same conviction 
which inspires confidence that nothing terrible lasts forever, or even for long, 
also enables us to see that in the midst of life's limited evils, nothing enhances our security so much as friendship.</p>
        <p align="justify"><a NAME="XXIX"></a><b>29)&nbsp; </b>Among desires some are natural and necessary, some
natural but not necessary, and others neither natural nor necessary, but due to 
        baseless
opinion.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXX"></a><b>30)</b>&nbsp; Those natural desires 
which create no pain when unfulfilled, though pursued with an intense effort, are also due to 
baseless opinion;
and if they are not dispelled, it is not because of their own nature, but 
because of human vanity.</p>

<p align="center"><i>The benefits of natural justice are far-reaching</i></p>
        <p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXI"></a><b>31)&nbsp; </b>Natural justice 
        is the advantage conferred by mutual agreements not to inflict nor allow 
        harm.</p>
        <p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXII"></a><b>32)</b>&nbsp; For all living 
        creatures incapable of making agreements not to harm one another, 
        nothing is ever just or unjust; and so it is likewise for all tribes of 
        men which have been unable or unwilling to make such agreements.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXIII"></a><b>33)</b>&nbsp; Absolute justice does 
not exist.&nbsp; There are only mutual agreements among men, made at various 
times and places, not to inflict nor allow harm.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXIV"></a><b>34)&nbsp;</b> Injustice is not an evil 
in itself, but only in consequence of the accompanying fear of being unable to 
escape those assigned to punish unjust acts.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXV"></a><b>35)</b>&nbsp; It is not possible for 
one who secretly violates the provisos of the agreement not to inflict nor allow 
harm to be confident that he won’t get caught, even if he has gotten away with 
it a thousand times before. For up until the time of death, there is no 
certainty that he will indeed escape detection.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXVI"></a><b>36)</b>&nbsp; Justice is essentially 
the same for all peoples insofar as it benefits human interaction.&nbsp; But the 
details of how justice is applied in particular countries or circumstances may 
vary.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXVII"></a><b>37)&nbsp; </b>Among actions legally 
recognized as just, that which is confirmed by experience as mutually beneficial 
has the virtue of justice, whether it is the same for all peoples or not. But if 
a law is made which results in no such advantage, then it no longer carries the 
hallmark of justice. And if something that used to be mutually beneficial 
changes, though for some time it conformed to our concept of justice, it is 
still true that it really was just during that time – at least for those who do 
not fret about technicalities and instead prefer to examine and judge each case 
for themselves.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXVIII"></a><b>38)</b>&nbsp; Where, without any 
change in circumstances, things held to be just by law are revealed to be in 
conflict with the essence of justice, such laws were never really just. But 
wherever or whenever laws have ceased to be advantageous because of a change in 
circumstances, in that case or time the laws were just when they benefited human 
interaction, and ceased to be just only when they were no longer beneficial.</p>
        <p align="center"><i>So happiness can be secured in all circumstances</i></p>
        <p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXIX"></a><b>39)&nbsp; </b>He who desires to live 
        in tranquility with nothing to fear from other men ought to make 
        friends.&nbsp; Those of whom he cannot make
friends, he should at least avoid rendering enemies; and if that is not in his power,
he should, as much as possible, avoid all dealings with them, and keep them aloof, 
        insofar as it is in his interest to do so.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XL"></a><b>40)</b>&nbsp; The happiest men are those who 
enjoy the condition of
having nothing to fear from those who surround them. Such men live among one another most
agreeably, having the firmest grounds for confidence in one another, enjoying the 
benefits of friendship in all their fullness, and they do not mourn a friend who dies before
they do, as if there was a need for pity.</p>

      Doctrines</i>...<p align="justify">
      <b>Plutarch, <i>Against Colotes</i>, 31, p. 
      1125E: </b>... in the first of the <i>Principal Doctrines,</i> [<b><a href="#I">PD

      religion].<p align="justify">
      <b>Lucian, <i>Alexander the Oracle Monger,</i> 
      47: </b>In this connection [railing against Epicurean debunkers] 
      Alexander once made himself supremely ridiculous. Coming across Epicurus’
      <i>Principal Doctrines,</i> the most admirable of his books, as you know, 
      with its terse presentment of his wise conclusions, he brought it into the 
      middle of the marketplace, there burned it on a fig wood fire for the sins 
      of its author, and cast its ashes into the sea. He issued an oracle on the 
      occasion: “The dotard’s maxims to the flames be given.”&nbsp; The fellow 
      had no conception of the blessings conferred by that book upon its 
      readers, of the peace, tranquillity, and independence of mind it produces, 
      of the protection it gives against terrors, phantoms, and marvels, vain 
      hopes and insubordinate desires, of the judgment and candor that it 
      fosters, or of its true purging of the spirit, not with torches and 
      squills and such rubbish, but with right reason, truth, and frankness.<p align="justify">
        <b>Diogenes Laertius, <i>Lives of Philosophers,</i> X.31 (Epicurus): </b>
        In the Canon, Epicurus specifically says that the standards of truth are 
        the sensations, the preconceptions, and the passions.&nbsp; The 
        Epicureans generally include mental impressions also.&nbsp; His own 
        statements may be found in the summary addressed to Herodotus, 
        and in the <i>Principal Doctrines</i>.&nbsp; [<b><a href="#XXIV">PD 24</a></b>]<p align="justify">

      doctrines of Epicurus which he called his <i>Principal </i>ones<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;–
      </span>Epicurus’ wicked sayings.&nbsp; Among these, indeed, there were 
      also the following claims: that Creation was established by chance<font color="#FF0000">
      </font>and not from the will and justice of God.&nbsp; Then, these rather 
        celebrated atoms, by colliding with one another and then dispersing, formed 
      the air, the earth, and the sea.&nbsp; Then the assemblies and compounds 
      disintegrate and completely disappear, dissolving into atoms.&nbsp; All of 
      creation, then, arises through necessity and happenstance, with no basis in 
      the wisdom of the Creator.&nbsp; Moreover, Epicurus maintains that 
      everything combined itself together without providence, without a 
      helmsman, nor guide, nor shepherd...&nbsp; That one, however, sacrificed 
      to the gods, and sent Epicurus and his <i>Doctrines</i> to the devil.<p align="center">
