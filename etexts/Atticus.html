<p align="justify">Titus Pomponius Atticus, descended from the most ancient Roman ancestry, kept
uninterrupted the equestrian rank inherited from his forbears. His father was industrious,
by the standards of those days wealthy, and greatly interested in literature. He, in
accord with his love of letters, educated his son in all those branches of learning in
which boyhood should be made to share. As a boy, in addition to a natural capacity for
learning, he also had an exceptionally agreeable expression and tone, so he not only
swiftly learned passages that were set, but also recited them extremely well. As a result
he had a distinguished reputation among his peers and shone forth more brightly than his
high-born schoolmates could bear with indifference. Thus he roused them all by his own
zeal: among their number were - Lucius Torquatus, the younger Gaius Marius, and Marcus
Cicero; with all of whom he became so close that no one was dearer to them throughout his
life.</p>

<p align="justify">His father died early. As a young man, because of his being an in-law of Publius
Sulpicius, who was killed while tribune of the plebians, he had some share in that danger;
for Anicia, a cousin of Pomponius on his mother's side, had married Servius, Sulpicius'
brother. So when Sulpicius was killed and Atticus saw that the state was thrown into
strife by the disorder Cinna incited, and that he was given no opportunity to live in
keeping with his rank without offending one side or the other - the citizens' loyalties
were divided with some favoring the party of Sulla, others that of Cinna - he thought it
was the right time to devote himself to his studies and moved to Athens. Nevertheless,
when the younger Marius had been declared an enemy of the state, he helped him from his
own resources and assisted his escape with money. And in order that his travels abroad
should do his estate no harm, he moved a substantial part of his fortune to Athens. There
he lived in such a manner that he became greatly beloved by all Athenians, and for good
reason. For apart from his personal charm which was already abundant in his youth, he
often relieved their public want from his own resources; when they were obliged to
roll-over the public debt and were unable to obtain reasonable terms for it, he always
intervened on terms where he never accepted usurious interest rates from them nor allowed
them to remain in debt beyond the term fixed. Both conditions were advantageous to them,
since he neither suffered their debt to become overdue by his leniency nor to grow through
compounding of the interest. He augmented this service by a further act of generosity: he
gave them all six modii [~50 liters] of wheat per person: the equivalent measure being
called a <i>medimnus</i> at Athens.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="athens.jpg" width="547" height="307"></p>

<p align="justify">His behavior in Athens was such that he showed himself to be at one with the humblest
and equal with the mighty. The result was that they bestowed upon him all the public
honors possible and desired to make him a citizen. This gift he was unwilling to take
advantage of, because the jurists hold that if one becomes a citizen elsewhere, Roman
citizenship is forfeited. So long as he lived there, he opposed the erection of any statue
to him, but when he left he could not stop them. And so they put up several statues to him
and Phidiae in their most sacred places, for in all the administration of the state's
business, they treated him as both agent and adviser. It was, therefore, fortune's
foremost gift that he was born in that very city where rulership over the world resided,
so that it was for him both his fatherland and home; on the other hand, it was a mark of
his wisdom that when he moved to the city which surpassed all others in its antiquity,
culture, and learning, he was dearer to it than all other men.</p>

<p align="justify">When Sulla came to Athens on his way back from Asia, he kept Pomponius by him as long
as he was there, captured by the young man's culture and learning. He spoke Greek so well
that he seemed a native Athenian; on the other hand his Latin was so graceful that its
charm seemed somehow inborn, not learned. He also recited poetry, both in Greek and in
Latin, so well that there was nothing further to be desired. The effect of this was that
Sulla at no point left him and wanted to take him back with him to Italy. When Sulla tried
to persuade him, 'No, please, I beg you,' said Atticus, 'I left Italy to avoid bearing
arms against you in the company of those men against whom you would lead me.' Sulla
praised the young man's sense of duty, and ordered that all the gifts which he had
received at Athens be passed on to him when he departed. He resided at Athens for several
years; he gave as much attention to his family estate as the careful master of a household
should, and devoted all the rest of his time either to literature or to the Athenians'
public affairs. At the same time he placed himself at the service of his friends in Rome,
for he often came to their elections, and never failed them if there was any important
action taken; thus, he was exceptionally loyal to Cicero in all his perils: when he fled
his country, Atticus made him a present of 250,000 sesterces [~7,800 troy ounces of
silver]. After calm was restored to affairs at Rome, he returned, I believe when Lucius
Cotta and Lucius Torquatus were consuls. On his departure the whole citizen body 
of Athens escorted him, showing by their tears their grief at his coming 
absence.</p>

<p align="justify">His uncle on his mother's side was Quintus Caecilius, a Roman knight and a friend of
Lucius Lucullus, a rich man of a very difficult nature. Atticus so respected his harshness
that he gave no offense and retained his goodwill - though no one else could stand him -
down to his old age and thereby reaped the fruits of his devotion, for Caecilius at his
death adopted him in his will and made him heir to three-quarters of his estate: from this
inheritance he received about 10 million sesterces [~312,500 troy ounces of silver].
Atticus' sister was married to Quintus Tullius Cicero; the marriage was arranged by Marcus
Cicero, with whom Atticus lived on very close terms ever since they were students
together, indeed much more intimately than with Quintus, which shows that similarity of
character carries more weight in friendship than ties of blood. He was also on such
intimate terms with Quintus Hortensius, who in those days was among the foremost in
eloquence, that one couldn't know whether Cicero or Hortensius loved him more dearly, and
he achieved the very difficult feat of preventing conflict between two men who so competed
for glory; he was himself the bond between these two men.</p>

<p align="justify">His conduct in public life was such that he always belonged and was regarded as
belonging to the <i>optimates</i> [the aristocratic party]; yet he did not commit himself
to the waves of civil disorder, for he considered that men who entrusted themselves to
such waves were no more in control than those who were tossed by the waves of the sea. He
did not seek offices, though they were open to him through both his influence and his
status; because they could not be canvassed for as in the good old days, and couldn't be
won without breaking the law amid the unlimited bribery and corruption, nor could they be
administered to the state's advantage without danger when public morals had been so
corrupted. He never took part in a public auction of confiscated property. He never became
a public surety or a public contractor [for farming tax-revenues]. He accused no one,
whether in his own name or as seconder; he never went to law on his own account; he never
exercised jurisdiction. The post of prefect, offered him by many consuls and praetors he
accepted on condition that he accompany no one to his province, be content with the honor
alone, and despise the profit to his estate. He would not even consent to go with Quintus
Cicero to Asia, though he might have obtained the post of legate [lieutenant-governor] on
his staff, for he said that it was not appropriate, after he had refused to hold a
praetorship [governorship], to be a praetor's assistant. He served therein the interests
not only of his dignity but also of his peace of mind, since he avoided any suspicion of
criminality. Consequently everyone valued more highly the courtesy which he showed them,
since they could see it was to be attributed to his genuine respect for others and not to
fear or hope.</p>

<p align="justify">When he was about 6o, Caesar's civil war broke out. He took advantage of the exemption
due to his age, and did not move away from Rome. Whatever his friends needed when they set
out to join Pompey he gave from his own fortune. Pompey himself, close though he was to
him, he did not offend. From him he was holding no award, as others did, who through him
had received either office or money; some of them most reluctantly joined his army, while
others remained at Rome and gave him the greatest offense. Atticus' inactivity was so
gratifying to Caesar that when he had won, and was demanding money from private
individuals by letter, not only did he give Atticus no trouble, but at his request
pardoned his sister's son and Quintus Cicero, as they were in Pompey's camp. Thus by his
old rule of life he avoided new dangers.</p>

<p align="justify">Then there was that time after Caesar's death, when it seemed that the state was in the
hands of the two Brutuses and Cassius, and that all the citizens had turned to them. He
was on such good terms with Marcus Brutus that the younger man was not closer to any of
those his own age than he was to Atticus, old though he was. Brutus kept him not only as
his principal adviser, but also as a daily companion. Some men formed the idea that a
private fund should be set up by the Roman equestrians for the assassins of Caesar. They
thought it could easily be brought about if the leading men of the order contributed
money. So Gaius Flavius, an intimate of Brutus, appealed to Atticus to lead the scheme.
But because he thought that services should be performed for friends, but not join
parties, and had always kept away from such plots, he replied that if Brutus wished to
make any use of his resources he might do so as far as they permitted, but that he would
neither discuss nor join with anyone in that plan. So the unity of the conspiratorial
association was shattered, just by this one man's disagreement.</p>

<p align="justify">Not long after that, Antony began to gain superiority, to such an extent that Brutus
and Cassius ceased to perform the duties assigned to them as a pretext by the Consul,
utterly despaired of the situation, and went into exile. But Atticus, who had refused to
contribute money along with others to that cause when it was prospering, sent Brutus, when
he was in dire straits and leaving Italy, a gift of 100,000 sesterces [~3,125 troy ounces
of silver]. In his absence,. he sent orders for another 300,000 sesterces [~9,375 troy
ounces of silver] to he given to Brutus in Epirus. He did not flatter Antony the more in
his time of power on that account nor abandon those in despair.</p>

<p align="justify">After that came the war fought at Modena. During it, if I just called him prudent, I
should praise him less than I should, since it was more properly a divination, if by
divination we mean a perpetual natural goodness which no circumstances shaken or lessen.
When Antony was adjudged a public enemy and left Italy, there was no hope of his
restoration. Not only his enemies, who were then very numerous and powerful, but also
those who had joined with his opponents and hoped by doing him harm to gain some
advantage, began to persecute Antony's friends, wanted to rob his wife Fulvia of all her
possessions, and even preparing to put his children to death.</p>

<p align="justify">Atticus, though he was very intimate with Cicero, and a close friend of Brutus, not
only gave them no encouragement towards injuring Antony, but on the contrary protected, as
far as he could, those close to him as they fled from the city, and helped them with
whatever they required. To Publius Volumnius he gave so much that more could not have come
from a parent. Further, to Fulvia herself, when she was distracted by lawsuits and
tormented by great anxiety, so diligently did he perform his services that she never
appeared in court without Atticus, and Atticus was her surety in all legal actions. Even
more, since she had in the days of her prosperity bought an estate to be paid for by a
fixed date, and was unable, after the calamity, to raise a loan, stepped in and lent her
the money with no interest and no stipulated terms, considering it his greatest gain to be
acknowledged as mindful of and grateful for favors, and at the same time to make it
obvious that he was accustomed to be a friend not to good fortune, but to people.</p>

<p align="justify">In so doing no one could think that he acted bide his time, for no one held the opinion
that Antony would return to power. But gradually he was most sharply criticized by several
<i>optimates</i>, because they thought he wasn't sufficiently hostile to bad citizens.
Atticus, however, being a man of independent judgment, considered what it was right for
him to do rather than what others were going to commend.</p>

<p align="justify">Fortune suddenly changed. Antony returned to Italy, and everyone thought that Atticus
was in very great danger because of his close intimacy with Cicero and Brutus. Thus, on
the eve of the junta's homecoming he had withdrawn from public life, fearing proscription,
and was in hiding at the house of Publius Volumnius, to whom, as I have explained, he had
helped shortly before. Such was the changeability of fortune at that time that now one
party, now the other, was at the extremes either of the heights of power or of the depths
of peril; he had with him Quintus Gellius Canus, a man of his own age and very similar to
him. This may also serve as an example of Atticus' goodness that he lived on such close
terms with this man, whom he had known as a boy in school, that their friendship continued
growing on down to their old age.</p>

<p align="justify">Antony on the other hand, though he was spurred on by such hatred for Cicero that he
was an enemy not only to him but to all his friends and wanted to proscribe them, as many
encouraged him to do, still remembered the services rendered him by Atticus. After he had
found out where he was, he wrote to him in his own hand telling him not to be afraid and
to come to him at once; he had removed his name, and for his sake Canus, from the list of
the proscribed. And so that no danger might befall him - that used to occur at night - he
sent him an escort. Thus Atticus at a time of great danger served to protect not only
himself but also the friend whom he held dearest. Nor did he seek aid from anyone for his
own safety alone, but did so also for his friend's, so that it appeared that he desired no
good fortune for himself that was not shared by his friend. But if the helmsman who saves
the ship from a storm in a rock-filled sea is exalted with the highest praise, why should
not the skill of a man who reached safety after such grave and numerous tempests of civil
strife be thought unparalleled? .</p>

<p align="justify">Once he emerged from these troubles, he made it his one goal to help as many people as
he could and in whatever manner he could. When the mob was seeking out those proscribed
for the rewards offered by the junta, no one came to Epirus who lacked for anything they
needed and everyone was given the means to stay there permanently. Even more, after the
battle of Philippi and the death of Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus, he even began to
protect Lucius Julius Mocilla, the ex-praetor, and his son, and Aulus Torquatus, and the
other victims of the same misfortune, ordering that all they needed should be transported
from Epirus to Samothrace. It is difficult to cover all the details, nor is it necessary.
I want one point clear, that his generosity did not depend on biding time or on
calculation of gain. It may be understood from the facts and circumstances themselves
since he did not sell himself to those in power but always helped those in trouble. He
even took care of Servilia, Brutus' mother, no less after his death than while she
prospered.</p>

<p align="justify">He was generous and pursued no quarrels, since he harmed no one, and if he had received
some injury, he certainly preferred to forget, not to avenge. He likewise retained the
kindness he had received in an unfailing memory, while those he had himself bestowed he
remembered for as long as the recipient was grateful. He so acted as to bear out the truth
of the saying 'it is each man's character that shapes his fortune'. Nor did he shape his
fortune before he shaped his character so as to take care not to ever be injured with
justification.</p>

<p align="justify">So by such conduct he brought it about that Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, who was a most
intimate friend of the young Caesar, although through his own influence and Caesar's power
had the opportunity of any match he desired, chose an alliance by marriage with the family
of Atticus, and preferred the daughter of a Roman equestrian over an <i>optimate</i>
bride. It was - and this is not to be concealed - Marcus Antonius, triumvir for
reconstituting the republic, who arranged this marriage. Where Atticus might have
increased his possessions through his influence, so far was he from a avaricious desire
for money that he only used his influence in begging the removal of his friends' dangers
or annoyances.</p>

<p align="justify">This was really quite evident during the proscription itself. Lucius Saufeius, who was
a Roman equestrian of the same age as Atticus, and who was drawn by his love of philosophy
to live several years in Athens, held valuable estates in Italy. When the triumvirs,
according to the manner in which things were done at the time, sold the property, Atticus'
good work and efforts brought it about that it was by the same messenger that Saufeius was
told both that he had lost, and that he had regained, his inheritance. Likewise for Lucius
Julius Calidus, who I truly think I can say is by far the most elegant poet which our age
has produced since the death of Lucretius and Catullus, and no less a good man and
well-educated in the most important arts; who was in his absence entered in the register
of the proscribed by Publius Volumnius, Antony's chief engineer, after the proscription of
the equestrians, on account of his large estates in Africa. It is hard to determine
whether it was at this time more troublesome or more glorious for Atticus, since it was
recognized that in their time of peril he cared for his friends whether present and
absent.</p>

<p align="justify"><img border="0" src="villa.jpg" align="right" vspace="7" width="365" height="405">But he was regarded as no less good a master of his household than he was a citizen.
Although he was wealthy, no man was less inclined to excess in buying and in building.
However, he did live extremely well and used the best of everything. His residence, built
by Tamphilus on the Quirinal hill, had been left to him by his uncle, the charm of which
lay not in the building but in the landscape, for the structure itself was built long ago
and had more taste than luxury. In it he changed nothing except in situations when he was
forced to by its age. His slaves, if judged by their usefulness, were excellent; if judged
by their appearance, mediocre. For among them there were highly educated slaves, excellent
readers, and numerous copyists, so there was not even a single footman who could not both
read and copy well. Similarly, the other specialists required for domestic comfort were
especially good. Notwithstanding this, he owned no one who wasn't born and trained in the
household; this is a sign not only of his restraint but also of his industry. For, first,
not to have immoderate desires, such as you would see in many, should be considered the
sign of self-control, and, second, to procure by work rather than by expenditures is a
sign of no ordinary determination. He was of good taste, not pretentious; distinguished,
not extravagant; and with all his efforts aimed not at excess but at elegance. His
furniture was moderate, not copious, so that it could not be noted for either excess.</p>

<p align="justify">Nor shall I pass over, although I think it may seem trivial, that though he was of the
richest Roman equestrians, and with no lack of hospitality invited to his home men of all
ranks, we know from his daily accounts he used to allow 3,000 sesterces [~ 94 troy ounces
of silver] a month on average for domestic expenses. This I state as a matter not reported
but observed, for I often joined in his life at home on account of our relationship.</p>

<p align="justify">At dinner-parties no one heard any entertainment other than a reader, which is quite
delightful in my opinion, nor was there ever a dinner at his house without some reading to
please his guests' minds not less than their bellies; for invited people whose way of life
was not incompatible with his own. When the great increase in his wealth occurred, he made
no change in his daily routine and displayed such moderation that neither on the 2 million
sesterces [~ 62,500 troy ounces of silver] which he had inherited from his father did he
live with insufficient splendor, nor on 10 million sesterces [~ 312,500 troy ounces of
silver] did he live in greater extravagance than before, and on both fortunes maintained
the same level. He had no gardens, no expensive villa near Rome or by the sea, nor any
country estate in Italy, except for those at Arezzo and Mentana. All his income came from
the estates in Epirus and Rome. From this one can see that he measured the usefulness of
money not by quantity but by reason.</p>

<p align="justify">He never told lies nor could endure them. Hence his courtesy did not lack severity nor
his gravity charm, so that it was difficult to understand whether his friends more
respected or loved him. Whenever a request was made him, he gave his word scrupulously,
because he thought it not generous but rather capricious to the extent that one could not
perform. He was also so careful in attending to what he had promised them that he gave the
impression of carrying out not a mandate for another but his own business. He never tired
of a venture once undertaken, for he thought his own reputation was involved in it, and
than that there was nothing dearer to him. Thus the consequence was that he looked after
all the business affairs of the Ciceros, of Marcus Cato, Quintus Hortensius, Aulus
Torquatus, and of many Roman equestrians besides. From this the judgment is permissible
that he avoided administration of the state's business not from indolence but from choice.</p>

<p align="justify">Of his humanity I can report no greater proof than that as a young man be was most dear
to Sulla in his old age, yet likewise as an old man was the same to the young Marcus
Brutus, while with men of his own age, Quintus Hortensius and Marcus Cicero, he lived on
such good terms that it is difficult to judge to which generation he was best suited. And
yet it was Cicero who held him in high esteem, so much so that not even his own brother
Quintus was dearer or closer to him. To demonstrate the point, apart from the published
works in which Cicero mentions Atticus, there are sixteen rolls of letters, sent to
Atticus from the time of his consulship to the end of his life. Whoever read them would
have little need of a continuous history of these times, for they offer so full a record
of everything to do with the leaders' policies, generals' blunders, and changes in the
state that there is nothing that does not appear in them, and it is easy to think that
Cicero's foresight was almost prophetic, for not only did he predict things which actually
happened in his lifetime, but also foresaw like a prophet events now currently
experienced.</p>

<p align="justify">What more should I tell of Atticus' devotion to his family? I heard him priding himself
on just this at his mother's funeral, whom he buried at the age of ninety, being himself
sixty-seven, that he never had occasion to need reconciliation with his mother nor
quarreled with his sister, who was roughly his own age. That is a sign either that no
conflict had ever occurred between them or that he was so indulgent towards his family
that he judged it vicious to be angry with those whom he ought to love. Nor did he do this
because of nature alone, although we all obey her, but also on account of his principles,
for he had so fully perceived the precepts of the principal philosophers that he employed
them for conducting his life, not for show.</p>

<p align="justify">He was a great follower of ancestral custom and lover of antiquity, which he had so
thorough a knowledge that he set it all out in the volume in which he placed the
magistrates of each year in order. For there is no law nor peace treaty nor war nor any
other illustrious deed of the Roman people which is not recorded in it at its proper date
and - this was most difficult - he has so worked out the genealogies of families that from
it we can learn the descendents of our famous men. He did the same thing in his other
books; thus at the request of Marcus Brutus he gave an account of the Junian family from
its origin to the present time, recording who was whose offspring, what magistracies he
held, and their dates. He did the same at Claudius Marcellus' request for the Marcelli, at
Cornelius Scipio's and Fabius Maximus' on the Fabii and Aemilii. There can be nothing more
delightful than these books to those who have some desire for knowledge about famous men. </p>

<p align="justify">He also touched on poetry in order to have some part, I suppose, in its charm, for it
was in verse that he celebrated those who surpassed the rest of the Roman people in honors
received and in the greatness of their deeds, inscribing beneath the portraits of each of
them their deeds and magistracies in not more than four or five verses. It is barely
believable that such important achievements could be set forth so concisely. There is also
a single book written in Greek on the consulate of Cicero.</p>

<hr WIDTH="25%" align="center">

<p align="center">ADDENDUM</font> </p>

<hr WIDTH="25%" align="center">

<p align="justify">The preceding chapters were published in Atticus' lifetime. Now, since fortune has
decreed that I survive him, I shall complete our account and so far as possible show my
readers by means of actual examples, as I indicated above, that for the most part it is
each man's character that determines his fortune. For content as he was with the
equestrian rank in which he was born, he married into the family of the emperor, son of
the deified Caesar; after having already won his friendship previously through no other
means than by the refined style of life thanks to which he had charmed the other leaders
of the city, Caesar's equals in standing but inferiors in good fortune. For such
prosperity befell Caesar that Fortune refused him nothing that she had given anyone
previously and granted him what no Roman citizen was able to achieve. To Atticus there was
born a granddaughter by Agrippa, to whom he had given his daughter in marriage as a girl.
This granddaughter Caesar betrothed when she was scarcely a year old to Tiberius Claudius
Nero his stepson [later known as the Emperor Tiberius], the son of Drusilla. This union
confirmed their close relations and rendered their friendly intercourse more frequent.</p>

<p align="justify">Even before this betrothal, when Octavian was absent from Rome, he never sent a letter
to any friend or kinsman without letting Atticus know what he was doing and above all what
be was reading, and where and for how long he was going to be staying. But also, when he
was in Rome and enjoyed Atticus' company less often than he might wish on account of his
countless engagements, hardly even a single day passed on which he did not write to him;
sometimes he asked him something about antiquity, sometimes he put him some difficult
passage in poetry, sometimes he jestingly coaxed longer letters from him. So it happened
that when the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, which had been founded on the Capitol by
Romulus, from age and neglect had lost its roof and was collapsing, it was at Atticus'
urging that Caesar saw to its restoration. Although far away, Marcus Antonius cultivated
him in correspondence no less, and so took care to inform Atticus exactly on what he was
doing from the ends of the earth. Just what this means will be more readily appreciated by
a reader who can judge how much wisdom it requires to retain the intimacy and goodwill of
those two men who were divided not only by a competition for the highest prizes, but by
such a mutual disparagement as was bound to occur between Caesar and Antony when each of
them desired to be the leader not only of the city of Rome but of the entire world.</p>

<p align="justify">He had completed seventy-seven years in such a manner, and into extreme old age had
advanced no less in dignity than in influence and fortune - for he obtained many
inheritances exclusively by his own goodness - and had enjoyed such good health that he
had not needed medicine for thirty years, then he fell ill. At the beginning neither he
nor his physicians took it seriously, for they thought it was a gripping of the bowel
[i.e. dysentery] for which swift and simple remedies were proposed. When he had suffered
for three months in this condition without any pain except for those he experienced from
the treatment, the disease burst so violently into his lower intestine that at the end
ulcers full of pus burst through his loins.</p>

<p align="justify">And before this befell him, after he felt the pains increase daily and the fever grow,
he gave orders for his son-in-law Agrippa to be summoned, and Lucius Cornelius Balbus and
Sextus Peducaeus along with him. When he saw they had come, he leaned on one elbow and
said: &quot;How much care and attention I have devoted to restoring my health recently I
do not need to tell at length, since I have you as witnesses. Since I have, I hope,
satisfied you that I have left nothing undone that might serve to cure me, all that is
left is that I now look after my own well-being. I did not wish you to be ignorant of my
purpose: for I am resolved no longer to nourish the disease. For however much food I have
taken in these last days, I have so prolonged my life as to increase the pain without hope
of recovery. Thus I beg of you both to approve of my resolution and not to try to shake me
by pointless dissuasion&quot;</p>

      <p align="justify"><img border="0" src="catacombs.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="290" height="367">After giving this speech with such resolve in his voice and expression that he seemed
not to be quitting life but moving from one house to another, Agrippa in particular
embraced him in tears and begged him not to hasten his death over and above nature's
compulsion, and, since even then he might survive the crisis, to preserve himself for his
own sake and for the sake of those dearest to him, but Atticus quelled his pleas with
silent obstinacy. So when he had abstained from food for two days, the fever suddenly
abated and the disease began to be more bearable. Nevertheless he carried through his
resolution undeviatingly and so died on the fifth day after he made his decision, on the
last day of March when Gnaeus Domitius and Gaius Sosius were consuls [March 31<sup>st</sup>,
22 BCE]. He was carried to his burial on a modest bier as he had himself directed,
without any funeral procession, but escorted by all men of substance and by very large
crowds of the common people. He was buried by the Appian Way at the fifth milestone, in
the tomb of his maternal uncle Quintus Caecilius.</p>
