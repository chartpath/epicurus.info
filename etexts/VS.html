        The Vatican Sayings (Unabridged)

        <p align="justify">This collection of maxims, titled
        <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">“</span>The Sayings of Epicurus<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">”

Epicurus<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">”

which also contained Marcus Aurelius&#146; Meditations, Epictetus&#146; Manual, and
similar works. We have no information regarding when or by whom the Vatican collection was
made.</p>

<p align="justify">Several of the Sayings are identical with some of the <a HREF="PD.html">Principal
Doctrines</a>.&nbsp; Some defy certain translation, and others are certainly not by Epicurus
(these instances are indicated by <font color="#808080"><b>grey</b></font> numerals). The set of English translations
presented here is a consensus of the best translations from various sources.<font size="-1">&nbsp;</font></p>

Doctrine 27</a></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XIV"></a><b>14)</b> We have been born once and there can be no second birth.
For all eternity we shall no longer be. But you, although you are not master of tomorrow,
are postponing your happiness. We waste away our lives in delaying, and each of us dies
without having enjoyed leisure. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XV"></a><b>15)</b> We place a high value on our characters as if they were our
own possessions whether or not we are virtuous and praised by other men. So, too, we must
regard the characters of those around us if they are our friends. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XVI"></a><b>16) </b>No one chooses a thing realizing that it is evil; but
when it appears as good in contrast to greater evil, he takes the bait and is caught. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XVII"></a><b>17)</b>  We should not regard the young man as happy, but rather
the old man whose life has been fortunate. The young man at the height of his power is
often baffled by fortune and driven from his course; but the old man has come to anchor in
age as in a harbor, and holds in certain and happy memory the accomplishments which he
once could only hope for. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XVIII"></a><b>18)</b> If sight, association, and intercourse are all
removed, the passion of love is ended. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XIX"></a><b>19)</b> He has become an old man on the day on which he forgot
his past blessings. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XX"></a><b>20) </b>= <a HREF="PD.html#XXXIX">Principal Doctrine
39</a></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXI"></a><b>21)</b> We must not resist Nature but submit to her. We shall
satisfy her if we satisfy the necessary desires and also those bodily desires that cause
us no harm while sternly rejecting those that are harmful.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXII"></a><b>22) </b>= <a HREF="PD.html#XIX">Principal Doctrine
19</a></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXIII"></a><b>23) </b>Every friendship in itself is to be desired; but the
initial cause of friendship is from its advantages.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXIV"></a><b>24)</b> Dreams have neither a divine nature nor a prophetic
power, but they are the result of images that impress us.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXV"></a><b>25) </b>Poverty, if measured by the natural purpose of life, is
great wealth; but wealth, if not limited, is great poverty.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXVI"></a><b>26) </b>One must presume that long and short arguments
contribute to the same end. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXVII"></a><b>27)</b> The benefits of other pursuits come to those who have
reached the end of a difficult course, but in the study of philosophy pleasure keeps pace
with growing knowledge; for pleasure does not follow learning; rather, learning and
pleasure advance side by side. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXVIII"></a><b>28) </b>Those who are hasty in making friends are not to be
approved; nor should you commend those who avoid friendship, for risks must be run for its
sake. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXIX"></a><b>29)</b> To be frank, I would prefer as I study nature to speak
in revelations about what is of advantage to all men even though it be understood by none,
rather than to conform to popular opinion and thus gain the scattered praise that is
broadcast by the many.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXX"></a><b><font color="#808080">30)</font> </b><font COLOR="#000000">Some men spend their whole life
furnishing for themselves the things proper to life without realizing that at our birth
each of us was poured a mortal brew to drink. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXI"></a><b>31)</b> It is possible to provide security against other
afflictions, but as far as death is concerned, we men all live in a city without walls. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXII"></a><b>32)</b> The honor paid to a wise man is a great good for
those who honor him. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXIII"></a><b>33)</b> The cry of the flesh bids us escape from hunger,
thirst, and cold; for he who is free of these and expects to remain so might vie in
happiness even with Zeus. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXIV"></a><b>34)</b> We do not so much need the help of our friends as the
confidence of their help in need. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXV"></a><b>35)</b> Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have
not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things only hoped for. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXVI"></a><font color="#808080"><b>36)</b> </font>Epicurus' life when compared to other men's in
respect of gentleness and self-sufficiency might be thought a mere legend.&nbsp;<a HREF="#**"><sup>
2&nbsp;</sup></a></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXVII"></a><b>37)</b> When confronted by evil the soul is weak, but not
when faced with good; for pleasures make the soul secure but pains ruin it. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXVIII"></a><b>38)</b> He is of very small account who sees many good
reasons for ending his life. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXXIX"></a><b>39)</b> Neither he who is always seeking material aid from
his friends nor he who never thinks of such aid as possible is a true friend; for the one
engages in petty trade, taking a favor instead of gratitude, and the other deprives
himself of hope for the future. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XL"></a><b>40)</b> He who says that all things happen by necessity can hardly
find fault with the one who denies that all happens by necessity; for on his own theory
this very argument is voiced by necessity. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XLI"></a><b>41) </b>At one and the same time we must philosophize, laugh, and
manage our household and other business, while never ceasing to proclaim the words of true
philosophy. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XLII"></a><b>42)</b> The time of the beginning of the greatest good
[pleasure] and the time of its enjoyment are one. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XLIII"></a><b>43)</b> The love of money, if unjustly gained, is foolish,
and, if justly, shameful; for it is offensive to be stingy even with justice on one's
side.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XLIV"></a><b>44)</b> The wise man who has become accustomed to the limits of
necessity knows better how to share with others than how to take from them, so great a
treasure of self-sufficiency has he found. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XLV"></a><b>45) </b>The study of nature does not create men who are fond of
boasting and clamoring or who show off the education that impresses the many, but rather
men who are strong and self-sufficient, and who take pride in their own personal qualities
not in those that depend on external circumstances.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XLVI"></a><b>46)</b> Let us completely banish our evil habits as if they
were evil men who have done us long and grievous harm. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XLVII"></a><font color="#808080"><b>47)</b> </font>I have anticipated thee, Fortune, and entrenched
myself against all thy secret attacks. And we will not give ourselves up as captives to
thee or to any other circumstance; but when it is time for us to go, spitting contempt on
life and on those who here vainly cling to it, we will leave life crying aloud in a
glorious triumph-song that we have lived well.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XLVIII"></a><b>48)</b> While we are on the journey of life, we must try to
make what is before us better than what is past; but when we come to the journey&#146;s
end, we must be content and calm. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XLIX"></a><b>49) </b>= <a HREF="PD.html#XII">Principal Doctrine
12</a></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="L"></a><b>50) </b>= <a HREF="PD.html#VIII">Principal Doctrine
8</a></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LI"></a><b>51)</b> [addressing a young man] I understand from you that your
natural disposition is too much inclined toward sexual passion. Follow your inclination as
you will, provided only that you neither violate the laws, disturb well-established
customs, harm any one of your neighbors, injure your own body, nor waste your possessions.
That you be not constrained by one or more of these conditions is impossible; for a man
never gets any good from sexual passion, and he is fortunate if he does not receive harm. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LII"></a><b>52)</b> Friendship dances through the world bidding us all to
awaken to the recognition of happiness. [<i>or</i> to awaken and give thanks.] </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LIII"></a><b><font color="#808080">53)</font></b> We must envy no one; for the good do not deserve envy
and as for the bad, the more they prosper, the more they ruin themselves.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LIV"></a><b>54)</b> It is not the pretended but the real pursuit of
philosophy that is needed; for we do not need the appearance of good health but to enjoy
it in truth. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LV"></a><b>55) </b>We should find solace for misfortune in the happy memory of
the things that are gone and in the knowledge that what has come to be cannot be undone. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LVI"></a><a NAME="LVII"></a><b><font color="#808080">56-57)
</font></b>The wise man is not more pained
when being tortured himself, than when seeing his friend tortured: but if his friend does
him wrong, his whole life will be confounded by distrust and completely upset.&nbsp;<a HREF="#***"><sup>
3&nbsp;</sup></a></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LVIII"></a><b>58)</b> We must free ourselves from the prison of private and
public affairs. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LIX"></a><b>59) </b>What cannot be satisfied is not a man&#146;s belly, as
men think, but rather his false idea about the unending filling of his belly. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LX"></a><b>60)</b> Every man passes out of life as if he had just been born.&nbsp;<a HREF="#[4]"><sup>
4&nbsp;</sup></a></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXI"></a><b><font color="#808080">61)</font></b> Most beautiful too is the sight of those near and dear to
us, when our original kinship makes us of one mind; for such sight is a great incitement
to this end.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXII"></a><b>62) </b>If the anger of parents against their children is
justified, it is quite pointless for the children to resist it and to fail to ask
forgiveness. If the anger is not justified but is unreasonable, it is folly for an
irrational child to appeal to someone deaf to appeals and not to try to turn it aside in
other directions by a display of good will.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXIII"></a><b>63) </b>There is also a limit in simple living. He who fails
to heed this limit falls into an error as great as that of the man who gives way to
extravagance. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXIV"></a><b>64)</b> We should welcome praise from others if it comes
unsought, but we should also be engaged in improving ourselves. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXV"></a><b>65) </b>It is folly for a man to pray to the gods for that which
he can attain by his own power. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXVI"></a><b>66) </b>We show our feeling for [deceased] friends, not by
wailing, but by pleasant recollection.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXVII"></a><b>67)</b> Since the attainment of riches can rarely be
accomplished without servitude to crowds or sovereigns, a free life cannot obtain much
wealth, but such a life has all necessities in unfailing supply. Should such a life happen
to fall upon great wealth, this too it can share as to gain the good will of those about. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXVIII"></a><b>68)</b> Nothing is ever enough for someone who regards
enough as insufficient.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXIX"></a><b>69)</b> The thankless nature of the soul makes the creature
endlessly hungry for refinements in its mode of living.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXX"></a><b>70) </b>Throughout your life, do nothing that will cause you fear
if it were to become known by your neighbor. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXXI"></a><b>71)</b> Evaluate each of your desires by this question:
&quot;What will happen to me if that which this desire seeks is attained, and what if it
is not?&quot; </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXXII"></a><b>72)</b> = <a HREF="PD.html#XIII">Principal Doctrine
13</a></p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXXIII"></a><b>73)</b> When we have suffered certain bodily pains, they
teach us to prevent others like them.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXXIV"></a><b>74) </b>In a philosophical dispute, he who is defeated gains
most, since he learns most. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXXV"></a><b>75) </b>The saying, &quot;Behold the end of a long life,&quot;
shows small thanks for past blessings. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXXVI"></a><b>76) </b>As you mature, you are such as I urge you to be, and
you have recognized the difference between studying philosophy for yourself and for
Greece. I rejoice with you. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXVII"></a><b>77)</b> Freedom is the greatest fruit of self-sufficiency. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXXVIII"></a><b>78)</b> The noble man is chiefly concerned with wisdom
and friendship; of these, the former is good for a lifetime, and the latter is good for
all time.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXXIX"></a><b>79) </b>He who has peace of mind disturbs neither himself nor
another. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXXX"></a><b>80) </b>The first step towards salvation is to safeguard
one&#146;s youth and to forestall those [cultural] influences which spoil everything with
insatiable desires.</p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="LXXXI"></a><b>81) </b>The soul neither rids itself of confusion nor gains a
joy worthy of the name through the possession of supreme wealth, nor by the honor and
admiration bestowed by crowds, nor through any of the other things sought by unlimited
desire. </p>
