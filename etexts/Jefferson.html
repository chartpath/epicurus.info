<p align="justify">To Mr. Short. </p>

<p align="justify"><img border="0" src="jefferson.jpg" align="right" vspace="4" alt="Thomas Jefferson" width="230" height="277">Dear Sir,&#151;Your favor of the 21st is received. My late illness, in which
you are so kind as to feel an interest, was produced by a spasmodic stricture
of the ilium, which came upon me on the 7th inst. The crisis was short,
passed over favorably on the fourth day, and I should soon have been well
but that a dose of calomel and jalap, in which were only eight or nine
grains of the former, brought on a salivation. Of this, however, nothing
now remains by a little soreness of the mouth. I have been able to get
on horseback for three or four days past. </p>

<p align="justify">As you say of yourself, I too am an Epicurian. I consider the genuine
(not the imputed) doctrines of Epicurus as containing everything rational
in moral philosophy which Greece and Rome have left us. Epictetus indeed,
has given us what was good of the stoics; all beyond, of their dogmas,
being hypocrisy and grimace. Their great crime was in their calumnies of
Epicurus and misrepresentations of his doctrines; in which we lament to
see the candid character of Cicero engaging as an accomplice. Diffuse,
vapid, rhetorical, but enchanting. His prototype Plato, eloquent as himself,
dealing out mysticisms incomprehensible to the human mind, has been deified
by certain sects usurping the name of Christians; because, in his foggy
conceptions, they found a basis of impenetrable darkness whereon to rear
fabrications as delirious, of their own invention. These they fathered
blasphemously on him who they claimed as their founder, but who would disclaim
them with the indignation which their caricatures of his religion so justly
excite. Of Socrates we have nothing genuine but in the Memorabilia of Xenophon;
for Plato makes him one of his Collocutors merely to cover his own whimsies
under the mantle of his name; a liberty of which we are told Socrates himself
complained. Seneca is indeed a fine moralist, disguising his work at times
with some Stoicisms, and affecting too much of antithesis and point, yet
giving us on the whole a great deal of sound and practical morality. But
the greatest of all the reformers of the depraved religion of his own country,
was Jesus of Nazareth. Abstracting what is really his from the rubbish
in which it is buried, easily distinguished by its lustre from the dross
of his biographers, and as separable from that as the diamond from the
dunghill, we have the outlines of a system of the most sublime morality
which has ever fallen from the lips of man; outlines which it is lamentable
he did not live to fill up. Epictetus and Epicurus give laws for governing
ourselves, Jesus a supplement of the duties and charities we owe to others.
The establishment of the innocent and genuine character of this benevolent
moralist, and the rescuing it form the imputation of imposture, which has
resulted from artificial systems, invented by ultra-Christian sects, and
unauthorized by a single word ever uttered by him, is a most desirable
object, and one to which Priestley has successfully devoted his labors
and learning. It would in time, it is to be hoped, effect a quiet euthanasia
of the heresies of bigotry and fanaticism which have so long triumphed
over human reason, and so generally and deeply afflicted mankind; but this
work is to be begun by winnowing the grain form the chaff of the historians
of his life. I have sometimes thought of translating Epictetus (for he
has never been tolerably translated into English) by adding the genuine
doctrines of Epicurus from the Syntagma of Gassendi, and an abstract form
the Evangelists of whatever has the stamp of the eloquence and fine imagination
of Jesus. The last I attempted too hastily some twelve or fifteen years
ago. It was the work of two or three nights only, at Washington, after
getting through the evening task of reading the letters and papers of the
day. But with one foot in the grave, these are now idle projects for me.
My business is to beguile the wearisomeness of declining life, as I endeavor
to do, by the delights of classical reading and of mathematical truths,
and by the consolations of a sound philosophy, equally indifferent to hope
and fear. </p>

<p align="justify">I take the liberty of observing that you are not a true disciple of
our master Epicurus, in indulging the indolence to which you say you are
yielding. One of his canons, you know, was that &quot;that indulgence which
prevents a greater pleasure, or produces a greater pain, is to be avoided.&quot;
Your love of repose will lead, in its progress, to a suspension of healthy
exercise, a relaxation of mind, an indifference to everything around you,
and finally to a debility of body, and hebetude of mind, the farthest of
all things from the happiness which the well-regulated indulgences of Epicurus
ensure; fortitude, you know is one of his four cardinal virtues. That teaches
us to meet and surmount difficulties; not to fly from them, like cowards;
and to fly, too, in vain, for they will meet and arrest us at every turn
of our road. Weigh this matter well; brace yourself up; take a seat with
Correa, and come and see the finest portion of your country, which, if
you have not forgotten, you still do not know, because it is no longer
the same as when you knew it. It will add much to the happiness of my recovery
to be able to receive Correa and yourself, and prove the estimation in
which I hold you both. Come, too, sand see your incipient University, which
has advanced with great activity this year. By the end of the next, we
shall have elegant accommodations for seven professors, and the year following
the professors themselves. No secondary character will be received among
them. Either the ablest which America or Europe can furnish, or none at
all. They will give us the selected society of a great city separated from
the dissipations and levities of its ephemeral insects. </p>

<p align="justify">I am glad the bust of Condorcet has been saved and so well placed. His
genius should be before us; while the lamentable, but singular act of ingratitude
which tarnished his latter days, may be thrown behind us. </p>

<p align="justify">I will place under this a syllabus of the doctrines of Epicurus, somewhat
in the lapidary style, which I wrote some twenty years ago; a like one
of the philosophy of Jesus of nearly the same age, is too long to be copied.

<ul>
<p align="justify"><i>Physical.</i>&#151;The Universe eternal. </p>

<p align="justify">Its parts, great and small interchangeable. </p>

<p align="justify">Matter and Void alone. </p>

<p align="justify">Motion inherent in matter which is weighty and declining. </p>

<p align="justify">Eternal circulation of the elements of bodies. </p>

<p align="justify">Gods, an order of beings next superior to man, enjoying in their sphere,
their own felicities; but not meddling with the concerns of the scale of
beings below them. </p>

<p align="justify"><i>Moral</i>.&#151;Happiness the aim of life. </p>

<p align="justify">Virtue the foundation of happiness. </p>

<p align="justify">Utility the test of virtue. </p>

<p align="justify">Pleasure active and In-do-lent. </p>

<p align="justify">In-do-lence, is the absence of pain, the true felicity. </p>

<p align="justify">Active, consists in agreeable motion; it is not happiness, but the means
to produce it. </p>

<p align="justify">Thus the absence of hunger is an article of felicity; eating the means
to obtain it. </p>

<p align="justify">The <i>summum bonum</i> is to be not pained in body, nor troubled in
mind. </p>

<p align="justify"><i>i.e. </i>In-do-lence of body, tranquillity of mind. </p>

<p align="justify">To procure tranquillity of mind we must avoid desire and fear, the two
principal diseases of the mind. </p>

<p align="justify">Man is a free agent. </p>

<p align="justify">Virtue consists in 1) Prudence. 2) Temperance. 3) Fortitude. 4) Justice.*
</p>

<p align="justify">To which are opposed, 1) Folly. 2) Desire. 3) Fear. 4) Deceit.</p>
