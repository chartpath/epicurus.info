        <b>Diogenes Laertius, <i>Lives of Philosophers,</i> X.26: </b>
        Epicurus was quite a prolific author, surpassing all in the quantity of 
        books produced.&nbsp; He authored, in fact, some three hundred books, and he 
        never cited any other authors – all the words contained in them were 
        Epicurus’ own.&nbsp; Chrysippus tried to match his vast literary output, but 
        Carneades denounced him as a literary parasite: “Indeed, if Epicurus had 
        written something, Chrysippus would vie to write just as much.&nbsp; To 
        accomplish this, he wrote down whatever popped into his head and often 
        repeated himself.&nbsp; In his haste, he neglected to do any editing, 
        and he used many lengthy citations to the point of filling his entire 
        books with them, not unlike Zeno and Aristotle.”&nbsp; <a name="dlx27">
        </a>Among the writings of 
        Epicurus, the following are his best:</p>

        He uses plain language in his works throughout, which is unusual, and 
        Aristophanes, the grammarian, reproaches him for it. He was so intent on

        he didn’t bother demanding anything else but clarity.</p>

        “I think that you, like our friend Triarius, are displeased with 
        Epicurus because he neglected the rhetorical embellishments of Plato, 
        Aristotle, and Theophrastus. I find it hard indeed to figure out why you 
        think his opinions untrue.” 
        <b>(Cicero to Torquatus): </b>
        “You will see, Torquatus,” said I, “how 
        mistaken you are. I am not annoyed by this philosopher’s style. He is 
        straightforward, expressing simple and plain concepts in a way that is 
        easy to understand; though I do not despise eloquence in a philosopher 
        either – but if he doesn’t have it, I do not insist on it.&nbsp; It’s in 
        the contents where he does not satisfy me, and in many places.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>Aulus Gellius, <i>Attic Nights</i>, II.9.4: </b>&nbsp;In 
        the same book {Book II of the <i>Essays On Homer</i>}, Plutarch finds 
        fault again with Epicurus for using an inappropriate word and giving it 
        an incorrect meaning. Now Epicurus wrote as follows: “The pinnacle 
        of pleasure is the removal of everything that pains.” Plutarch declares 
        that he ought not have said “of everything that pains,” but “of 
        everything that is painful;” for it is the removal of pain, he explains, 
        that should be indicated, not of that which causes pain. In bringing 
        this charge against Epicurus, Plutarch is “word-chasing” with excessive 
        nit-picking and almost with frigidity; for rather than hunting up such 
        verbal meticulousness and such refinements of diction, Epicurus hunts 
        them down {implying that Epicurus deliberately eliminates them}.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
        <b>Cicero, <i>On End-Goals, Good and Bad,</i> II.4.12: </b>You Epicureans 
        frequently tell us we do not correctly understand what pleasure might 
        be which Epicurus refers to...&nbsp; <b>Ibid. II.5.15 </b>&nbsp;Nevertheless, 
        supposing that I don’t understand Epicurus’ intended meaning... then he 
        himself might possibly be at fault, for speaking in such a way that 
        defies understanding.&nbsp; Obscurity may be excused for two reasons: it 
        might be intentional, like with Heraclitus... or it may reflect the 
        difficulty of the material, rather than the rhetoric, as, for example, 
        in Plato’s <i>Timaeus</i>.&nbsp; But Epicurus, as far as I can tell, 
        neither refuses to speak in a simple and explicit manner whenever he 
        can, nor does he speak here about an obscure subject, such as physics, 
        or an artificial and technical subject, like mathematics.&nbsp; Pleasure 
        is an easy topic that everyone can relate to.</p>

        found the truth through his vast wisdom and knowledge, and so thinks it 
        right that he should also take first prize.&nbsp; That is why I would believe 
        it to be quite wrong for someone to say to <i>him</i>: “Babbling 
        Thersites, clear orator though you are, hold off!” {Homer, <i>Iliad</i> 
        2.246-247}.&nbsp; For I would not also call <i>this</i> Thersites “clear,” as 
        Odysseus does the Homeric one, when on top of everything else his mode 
        of expression is also elaborately corrupt.&nbsp; He speaks of “tranquil 
        conditions of flesh” and “the confident expectations regarding it” and 
        describes a tear as a “glistening of the eyes,” and speaks of &nbsp;“sacred 
        ululations” and “titillations of the body” and “debaucheries” and other 
        such dreadful horrors.&nbsp; Some of these expressions might be said to have 
        brothels as their source, others to resemble the language of women 
        celebrating the rites of Demeter at the Thesmorphoria, still others to 
        come from the synagogue and its suppliants

        <b>Plutarch, <i>Against Colotes</i>, 7, p. 1110C:</b> It is not hard to 
        see that this reasoning may be applied to every object called or 
        commonly held to be biter, sweet, cathartic, soporific, or luminous: 
        that none has a self-contained quality or potency or is more active than 
        passive on entering the body, but acquires different properties as it 
        blends with different bodies.&nbsp; Accordingly, Epicurus himself in the 
        second book <i>Against Theophrastus,</i> when he says that colors are 
        not intrinsic to bodies but a result of certain arrangements and 
        positions relative to the eye, is asserting by this reasoning that body 
        is no more colorless than colored.&nbsp; Earlier in the word, he writes 
        word for word as follows: “{= <font size="2" face="Arial">
        <b>
        <a href="#U29">U29</a></b></font><font face="Times New Roman">}, True, it 
        often happens that when objects are enveloped in air of the same degree 
        of darkness, some people perceive a distinction of color while others 
        whose eyesight is weak do not; again, on first entering a dark room we 
        see no color, but do after waiting a short time.</font>”&nbsp; Therefore 
        no body will any more be said to have color than not.&nbsp; If color is 
        relative, white and blue will be relative; and if these, then also sweet 
        and bitter, so that of every quality we can truly say, “<font face="Times New Roman">It 
        is no more this than it is not this;</font>” for to those affected in a certain way the thing will be

        their treatises they explain the occasion of the symposium, and who are 
        present.&nbsp; But Epicurus specifies no place, no time; he has no

        <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Certain 
        young men with no long experience in the ancient literature were 
        attacking Epicurus on the ground that he had introduced in his <i>
        Symposium</i> an unseemly and unnecessary discussion about the proper 
        time for coition.&nbsp; For an older man to talk about sex in the presence of 
        youths at a dinner-party and weigh the pros and cons of whether one 
        should make love before dinner or after dinner was, they claimed, the 
        extreme of indecency.&nbsp; At this, some of our company brought up Xenophon, 
        who, so to speak, took his guests home after dinner, not on foot, but on 
        horseback, to make love to their wives.&nbsp; And Zopyrus the physician, 
        who was very well acquainted with the works of Epicurus, added that they 
        had not read Epicurus’ <i>Symposium</i> with attention; for Epicurus did not 
        propose the problem as one involving a principle or a settled procedure 
        and then proceed with his discussion of it; but he took the young men 
        for a walk after dinner, conversed with them for the purpose of moral 
        instruction, and restrained them from their lust on the ground that 
        intercourse is always precarious and harmful, and affects worse those 
        who engage in it when the have been eating and drinking.&nbsp; “Indeed,” said 
        he {Zopyrus}, “even if intercourse were the chief topic of his inquiry, 
        would it be to the philosopher’s credit to have refrained entirely from 
        all consideration of the right time and hour for coition?&nbsp; Would it not 
        be better for him to engage, at the proper moment, in rational 
        discussion of such matters?&nbsp; And would it be to his credit that he 
        consider this stage of his discussion not inappropriate to any occasion 
        except drinking and dining, and there shameful?”...&nbsp; This put the young 
        men out of countenance, and they sat in silence.&nbsp; The rest of the 
        company asked Zopyrus to give them an account of what Epicurus had to 
        say about this matter, and he replied that he did not remember the 
        particulars accurately, but thought that the man feared the afflictions 
        resulting from coition, due to the disturbance caused by our bodies 
        entering into the tumult and turmoil of such activity.&nbsp; For wine is 
        generally a brawler, an instigator of tumult, and unsettles our body 
        from its base; and if tranquility and sleep do not take possession of 
        our body when it is in this condition, but the new disturbances of 
        coition supervene, the forces which naturally tie together and cement 
        the body are crushed and dislodged, and there is danger that the body be 
        unseated, like a house shifted from its foundations – for the seed does 
        not flow easily at this time, repletion blocking it, but with effort it 
        is extracted in a clotted mass.&nbsp; Consequently our man says that we must 
        engage in such activity when the body is quiet and ended are the 
        assimilations and fluxes of the nourishment which traverses and quits 
        the body, and must do so before the body is again in need of further 
        nourishment. <b>654B:</b> Let us consider, if you will, whether it is 
        proper and fitting, or contrary to all justice, for Epicurus to deprive 
        Aphrodite of night ... <b>655A:</b> Surely the body would not suffer 
        greater harm by coition after dinner, as Epicurus thinks it does, 
        provided a man does not make love when he is over-burdened, drunk or 
        stuffed full to the point of bursting.&nbsp; For of course, if that is the 
        case, the thing is precarious and harmful.&nbsp; But if a man is sufficiently 
        himself and moderately relaxed, his body at ease and his spirit disposed 
        and if then after an interval he makes love, he neither causes his body 
        great disturbance, nor does he bring on any morbid excitement or 
        unsettling of atoms, as Epicurus claims.</span><p align="center">

        great results from them, or as if I thought it a matter of such great

        truth without anyone’s assistance, carving out their own passage. And he 
        gives special praise to these, for their impulse has come from within, 
        and they have forged to the front by themselves. Again, he says, there 
        are others who need outside help, who will not proceed unless someone 
        leads the way, but who will follow faithfully. Of these, he says, 
        Metrodorus was one; this type of man is also excellent, but belongs to 
        the second grade. We ourselves are not of that first class, either; we 
        shall be well-regarded if we are admitted into the second. Nor need you 
        despise a man who can gain salvation only with the assistance of 
        another; the will to be saved means a great deal, too.&nbsp; You will 
        find still another class of man <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">

        need a guide as much as they require someone to encourage and, as it 
        were, to force them along. This is the third variety. If you ask me for 
        a man of this pattern also, Epicurus tells us that Hermarchus was such.

        one, but he feels more respect for the other; for although both have 
        reached the same goal, it is a greater credit to have brought about the

          who desired to come to the relief of the errors that appear to upset 
          our power of knowing the truth, and who said that the separation of 
          opinion from perspicuous truth was the function of the wise man,

        the School of Pyrrho …&nbsp; Epicurus took the ground that the subjects 
        taught are of no help in perfecting wisdom; and he did this, as some 
        speculate, because he saw in it a way of covering up his own lack of 
        culture (for in many matters Epicurus stands convicted of ignorance, and 
        even in ordinary conversation, his speech was not correct).&nbsp; Another 
        reason may have been his hostility towards Plato and Aristotle and their 
        like who were men of wide learning.</p>

        do, in perusing poets, who give us nothing solid and useful, but merely 
        childish amusement?&nbsp; Was he to occupy himself like Plato with music and 
        geometry, arithmetic and astrology, which starting from false premises 
        cannot be true, and which moreover if they were true would contribute 
        nothing to make our lives pleasanter and therefore better?&nbsp; Was he, I 
        say, to study arts like these, and neglect the master art, so difficult 
        and correspond so fruitful, the art of living?&nbsp; No! Epicurus was not 
        uneducated: the real philistines are those who ask us to go on studying 
        till old age the subjects that we are supposed to be ashamed of not 
        learning in childhood.</p>

        Stoics realized this, for they said that slaves and women ought to 
        engage in philosophy; Epicurus, also, who summoned even the illiterate

        Logic, on which your {Platonic} school lays such stress, he held to be 
        of no effect either as a guide to conduct or as an aid to thought. 
        Natural Philosophy he deemed all-important. This science explains to us 
        the meaning of terms, the nature of predication, and the law of 
        consistency and contradiction; secondly, a thorough knowledge of the 
        facts of nature relieves us of the burden of superstition, frees us from 
        fear of death, and shields us against the disturbing effects of 
        ignorance, which is often in itself a cause of terrifying apprehensions; 
        lastly, to learn what nature’s real requirements are improves the moral 
        character also. Besides, it is only by firmly grasping a 
        well-established scientific system, observing the Rule or Canon that has 
        fallen as it were from heaven so that all men may know it—only by making 
        that Canon the test of all our judgments, that we can hope always to 
        stand fast in our belief unshaken by the eloquence of any man. On the 
        other hand, without a full understanding of the world of nature it is 
        impossible to maintain the truth of our sense-perceptions. Further, 
        every mental presentations has its origin in sensation: so that no 
        certain knowledge will be possible, unless all sensations are true, as 
        the theory of Epicurus teaches that they are. Those who deny the 
        validity of sensation and say that nothing can be perceived, having 
        excluded the evidence of the senses, are unable even to expound their 
        own argument. Besides, by abolishing knowledge and science they abolish 
        all possibility of rational life and action. Thus Natural Philosophy 
        supplies courage to face the fear of death; resolution to resist the 
        terrors of religion; peace of mind, for it removes all ignorance of the 
        mysteries of nature; self-control, for it explains the nature of the 
        desires and distinguishes their different kinds; and, as I showed just 
        now, the Canon or Criterion of Knowledge, which Epicurus also 
        established, gives a method of discerning truth from falsehood. </p>

        Equivocation. The Criteria of reality he places in sensation; once let 
        the senses accept as true something that is false, and every possible

          Epicurus says that there are two things which are linked to each 
        other, presentation and opinion, and that of these <i>presentation</i> 
        (which he also calls ‘clear fact’) is always true.&nbsp; For just as the 
        primary feelings, i.e., pleasure and pain, come to be from certain 
        productive factors and in accordance with productive factors themselves 
        (for example, pleasure comes to be from pleasant things and pain from 
        painful things, and what causes pleasure can never fail to be pleasant, 
        nor can what produces pain not be painful; but rather, it is necessary 
        that what gives pleasure should be pleasant and that what gives pain 
        should, in its nature, be painful), likewise, in the case of 
        presentations, which are feelings within us, what causes each of them is 
        presented in every respect and unqualifiedly, and since it is presented 
        it cannot help but exist in truth just as it is presented […<i>lacuna</i>…]&nbsp; 
        that it is productive of presentation.&nbsp; And one must reason similarly 
        for the individual senses.&nbsp; For what is visible not only is <i>presented</i> 
        as visible but also <i>is such </i>as it is presented; and what is 
        audible is not only presented as audible, but also is like that in 
        truth; and similarly for the rest.&nbsp; Therefore, it turns out that all 
        presentations are true.&nbsp; And reasonably so.&nbsp; For if, the Epicureans say, 
        a presentation is true if it comes from an existing object and in 
        accordance with the existing object, and if every presentation arises 
        from the object presented and in accordance with the presented object 
        itself, then necessarily every presentation is true.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          Some people are deceived by the difference among impressions seeming 
          to reach us from the same sense-object, for example a visible object, 
          such that the object appears to be of a different color or shape, or 
          altered in some other way.&nbsp; For they have supposed that, when 
          impressions differ and conflict in this way, one of them must be true 
          and the opposing one false.&nbsp; This is simple-minded, and characteristic 
          of those who are blind to the real nature of things.&nbsp; Let us make our 
          case for visible things.&nbsp; For it is not the whole solid body that is 
          seen<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">&nbsp;–
          </span>to take the example of visible things<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">&nbsp;–
          </span>but the color of the solid body.&nbsp; And of color, some is right 
          on the solid body, as in the case of things seen from close up or from 
          a moderate distance, but some is outside the solid body and is 
          objectively located in the space adjacent to it, as in the case of 
          things seen from a great distance.&nbsp; This color is altered in the 
          intervening space, and takes on a peculiar shape.&nbsp; But the impression 
          which it imparts corresponds to what is its own true objective state.&nbsp; 
          Thus just as what we actually hear is not the sound inside the beaten 
          gong, or inside the mouth of the man shouting, but the sound which is 
          reaching our senses, and just as no one says that the man who hears a 
          faint sound from a distance hears is falsely just because on 
          approaching he registers it as louder, so too I would not say that the 
          vision is deceived just because from a great distance it sees the 
          tower as small and round but from near-to as larger and square.&nbsp; 
          Rather I would say that it is telling the truth.&nbsp; Because when the 
          sense-object appears to it small and of that shape it really is small 
          and of that shape, the edges of the images getting eroded as a result 
          of their travel through the air.&nbsp; And when it appears big and of 
          another shape instead, it likewise is big and of another shape 
          instead.&nbsp; But the two are already different from each other: for it is 
          left for distorted opinion to suppose that the object of impression 
          seen from near and the one seen from far off are one and the same.&nbsp; 
          The peculiar function for sensation is to apprehend only that which is 
          present to it and moves it, such as color, not to make the distinction 
          that the object here is a different one from the object there.&nbsp; Hence 
          for this reason all impressions are true.&nbsp; Opinions, on the other 
          hand, are not all true but admit of some difference.&nbsp; Some of them are 
          true, some false, since they are judgments which we make on the basis 
          of our impressions, and we judge some things correctly, but some 
          incorrectly, either by adding and appending something to our 
          impressions or by subtracting something from them, and in general 
          falsifying irrational sensation.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          According to Epicurus, some opinions are true, some false. True 
          opinions are those which are attested by and not contested by clear 
          facts, while false opinions are those which are contested and not 
          attested by clear facts. Attestation is perception through a 
          self-evident impression, that the object of opinion is such as it once 
          was thought to be—for example, if Plato is approaching from far off, I 
          form the conjectural opinion, owing to the distance, that it is Plato. 
          But then he has come close, there is further testimony that he is 
          Plato, now that the distance is reduced, and it is attested by the 
          self-evidence itself. Non-contestation is the conformity between a 
          non-evident thing which is the object of speculation, and the opinion 
          about what is apparent—for example, Epicurus, in saying that void 
          exists, which is non-evident, confirms this through the self-evident 
          fact of motion. For if void does not exist, there ought not be motion 
          either, since the moving body would lack a place to pass into as a 
          consequence of everything being full and solid. Therefore, the 
          non-evident thing believed is not contradicted by that which is 
          evident, since there is motion. Contestation, on the other hand, is 
          opposed to non-contestation, for it is the elimination of that which 
          is apparent by the positing of the non-evident thing—for example, the 
          Stoic says that void does not exist, something non-evident; but once 
          this denial is put forward, then that which is evident, namely motion, 
          ought to be co-eliminated with it. For if void does not exist, then 
          motion does not occur either, according to the method already 
          demonstrated. Non-attestation, likewise, is opposed to attestation, 
          for it is confirmation through self-evidence of the fact that the 
          object of opinion is not such as it was believed to be—for example, if 
          someone is approaching from far off, we conjecture, owing to the 
          distance, that he is Plato. But when the distance is reduced, we 
          recognize through self-evidence that it is not Plato. This sort of 
          thing turns out to be non-attestation.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          So attestation and non-contestation are the criterion of something’s 
          being true, while non-attestation and contestation are the criterion 
          of its being false. And self-evidence is the foundation and basis of 
          all [four] of these.</p>

          when people take sensation to be deceptive because they see that the

          everything is mixed and compounded with everything else, and since 
          different substances are naturally adapted to fit different passages, 
          the consequence is that everyone does not come into contact with and

          affect everyone in the same way with every part.&nbsp; What happens 
          instead is that different sets of persons encounter only those 
          components to which their sense organs are perfectly adjusted, and

          object is good or bad or white or not white, imagining that they are 
          confirming their own perceptions by denying one another’s.&nbsp; The 
          truth of the matter is that no sense-perception should be challenged,

          the multiple mixture as from a fountain what agrees with and suits

          contact is with parts, nor fancy that all persons should be affected

        Colotes: the reasoning that he accepts with satisfaction when he finds 
        it in the writings of Epicurus he neither understands nor recognizes 
        when it is used by others.&nbsp; For the school that asserts that when a 
        round image impinges on us, or in another case a bent one, the important 
        is truly received by the sense, but refuses to allow us to go further 
        and affirm that the tower is round or that the oar is bent, maintains 
        the truth of its experiences and sense impressions, but will not admit 
        that external objects correspond; and as surely as that other school 
        must speak of “being horsed” and “walled,” but not of a horse or wall, 
        so this school of theirs is under the necessity of saying that the eye 
        is rounded or be-angled, and not that the oar is bent or the tower 
        round, for it is the image producing the effect in the eye that is bent, 
        whereas the oar is not bent from which the image proceeded.&nbsp; Thus, since 
        the effect produced on the senses differs from the external object, 
        belief must stick to the effect or be exposed as false if it proceeds to 
        add “it is” to “it appears.”&nbsp; That vociferous and indignant protest of 
        theirs in defense of sensation, that it does not assert the external 
        object to be warm, the truth being merely that the effect produced in 
        sensation has been of this kind – is it not the same as the statement 
        about taste?&nbsp; Why does it not assert, if the external object is sweet, 
        that there has merely occurred in the taste an effect and movement of 
        this kind?&nbsp; A man says “I receive an impression of humanity, but I do 
        not perceive whether a man is there.”&nbsp; Who put him in the way of such a 
        notion?&nbsp; Was it not the school who asserts that they receive an 
        impression of curvature, but that their sight does not go beyond to 
        pronounce that the thing is curved or yet that it is round’ there has 
        merely occurred in it an appearance and impression of rotundity?</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          “Exactly,” someone will say, “but for my part I shall go up to the 
          tower and I shall feel the oar, and thereupon I shall pronounce the 
          oar straight and the tower angular; but this other fellow even at 
          close quarters will only grant he has this ‘view’ and that there is 
          this ‘appearance,’ but will grant nothing more.”&nbsp; Exactly, my good 
          friend, since he is a better hand than you at noticing and holding to 
          the consequences of his doctrine – that every sensation is equally 
          trustworthy when it testifies on its own behalf, but none when it 
          testifies on behalf of anything else, but all are on the same 
          footing.&nbsp; And here is an end to your tenet that all sensations are 
          true and none untrustworthy or false – if you think it proper for one 
          set of them to proceed to make assertions about external objects, 
          whereas you refused to truth the others in anything beyond the 
          experience itself.&nbsp; For if they are on the same footing of 
          trustworthiness whether they come close or are at a distance, it is 
          only fair to confer on all the power of adding the judgment “it is” or 
          else to deny it to the former as well.&nbsp; Whereas if there is a 
          difference in the effect produced on the observer when he stands at a 
          distance and when he is close at hand, it is false to say that no 
          impression and no sensation has in its stamp of reality a better 
          warrant of truth than another.&nbsp; So too the “testimony in confirmation” 
          and “testimony in rebuttal” of which they speak has no bearing on the 
          sensation but only on our opinion of it; so if they tell us to be 
          guided by this testimony when we make statements about external 
          objects, they appoint opinion to pass the verdict “it is” and sense to 
          undergo the experience “it seems,” and thus transfer the decision from 
          what is unfailingly true to what is often wrong.</p>

        debate may be agreed as to what the subject is about which they are 
        debating.&nbsp; This rule is laid down by Plato in <i>Phaedrus,</i> and 
        it was approved by Epicurus, who realized that it ought to be followed

		demonstrate also that place is not extension.&nbsp; An extension is what is 
		conceived of as between the limits of the container, e.g., what is 
		within the hollow surface of the pot.&nbsp; Now this belief is traditional, 
		and associated with those who posit the void, yet later both Chrysippus’ 
		crowd and Epicurus were nonetheless adherents.&nbsp; Some imposed the 
		doctrine on Plato too.&nbsp; It relies on a plausible explanation, yet one 
		that is quite false: namely, since we reach a conception of place in 
		general from the mutual replacement of bodies (i.e., from different 
		bodies continually coming to be in the same place at different times), 
		they took place to be the intervening extension, which they believed 
		remained the same when it received the bodies that were replacing one 
		another, while being separated from each of these incoming bodies.&nbsp; 
		Vessels above all egged them on to this inference.&nbsp; For since water and 
		air enter the vessel at different times while the hollow surface within 
		the clay remains the same (i.e. circumscribed by unique limits), they 
		inferred the existence of the extension within the hollow surface, which 
		resembled the surface of the vessel in remaining the same (i.e., 
		separated from the bodies) as it received the bodies in succession.&nbsp; But 
		this is invalid.&nbsp; If the vessel could at any time be devoid of body, 
		then perhaps this so-called “extension” would be detected <i>per se</i>.&nbsp; 
		But, as it is, fluid flows out and air simultaneously enters to replace 
		it, and that leads them astray.&nbsp; For since every body is accompanied by 
		an extension, they transfer the extension belonging to bodies to place, 
		without reasoning that an extension is always in place just because a 
		body always&nbsp; is too, as completely covered bronze vessels reveal: for 
		[in their case] there would be no efflux of fluid unless the air 
		acquired a space for its influx.&nbsp; What dupes them is that the vessels’ 
		hollow surface also always remains rigid; but if there were an implosion 
		when the fluid was extracted, as there is in the case of wine-skins, 
		they would not be similarly deluded.</p>

        constituents, and that over the whole magnitude composed of part-less 
        constituents the moving object moves, but at each of the part-less 
        magnitudes contained in it, it does not move but has moved; for if it 
        were laid down that the object moving over the whole magnitude moves 
        over these too, they would turn out to be divisible.</p>

        Cicero, <i>On End-Goals, Good and Bad,</i> I.6.18: </b>&nbsp;Epicurus 
        for his part, where he follows Democritus, does not generally blunder. 
        ... I now come to the lapses peculiar to Epicurus. He believes that 
        these same indivisible solid bodies are borne by their own weight 
        perpendicularly downward, which he holds is the natural motion of all 
        bodies; but thereupon this clever fellow, being met with the difficulty 
        that if they all traveled downwards in a straight line, and, as I said, 
        perpendicularly, no one atom would ever be able to overtake any other 
        atom, accordingly introduced an idea of his own invention: he said that 
        the atom makes a very tiny swerve—the smallest divergence possible; and 
        thus produces entanglements and combinations and cohesion of atoms with 
        atoms, which result in the creation of the world, and all its parts, and 
        of all that in them is. Now not only is this whole affair a piece of 
        childish fancy, but it does not even achieve the result that its author 
        desires. The swerving is itself an arbitrary fiction; for Epicurus says 
        the atoms swerve without cause—yet this is the capital offense in a 
        natural philosopher, to speak of something taking place uncaused. Then 
        also he gratuitously deprives the atoms of what he himself declared to 
        be the natural motion of all heavy bodies, namely, movement in a 
        straight line downwards, and yet he does not attain the object for the 
        sake of which this fiction was devised. For, if all the atoms swerve, 
        none will ever come to cohere together; or if some swerve while others 
        travel in a straight line, but their own natural tendency, in the first 
        place this will be tantamount to assigning to the atoms their different 
        spheres of action, some to travel straight and some sideways; while 
        secondly (and this is a weak point with Democritus also) this riotous 
        hurly-burly of atoms could not possibly result in the ordered beauty of 
        the world we know.</p>

        Cicero, <i>On Fate, </i>10.22: </b> 
        Epicurus, however, thinks that the necessity of fate is avoided by the 
        swerve of the atom; and so a certain third movement arises, part from 
        weight and collision, when the atom swerves by a very small distance – 
        this he calls a “minimum.” That this swerve comes about without a cause 
        he is compelled to admit, if not by his words, by the facts themselves. 
        For it is not the case that an atom swerves when struck by another; for 
        how can one be struck by another if individual bodies are carried 
        downwards by their weight in straight lines, as Epicurus supposes? For 
        if one is never struck from its course by another, it follows that none 
        even touches another; and from this it results that, even if there is an 
        atom and it swerves, it does so without cause.&nbsp; Epicurus introduce 
        this theory because he was afraid that, if the atom was always carried 
        along by its weight in a natural and way, we would have no freedom, 
        since our mind would be moved in the way in which it was constrained by 
        the movement of the atoms. Democritus, the inventor of the atoms, 
        preferred to accept this, that all things come about through fate, 
        rather than to remove the natural movements of individual bodies from 
        them.<b></p>
          <p align="justify">
        <i>Ibid. </i>20.46:</b> 
        This is how the case ought to be argued; one ought not to seek help from 
        atoms that swerve and deviate from their path. “The atom swerves,” he 
        says. First why? For the atoms will have one force to move them from 
        Democritus, the force of an impulse which he calls a blow, and from you, 
        Epicurus, the force of weight and heaviness. So what new cause is there 
        in nature to make the atom serve? Or do they draw lots among themselves 
        which will swerve and which not? Or why do they swerve by a minimum 
        interval and not by a larger one, or why do they swerve by one minimum 
        and not by two or three? This is wishful thinking, not argument.&nbsp; 
        For you do not say that the atom is moved from its position and swerves 
        through an impulse from outside, nor that in that void through which the 
        atom travels there was any cause for its not traveling in a straight 
        line; nor has there been any change in the atom itself as a result of 
        which it might no preserve the motion natural to its weight. So, 
        although [Epicurus] has not brought forward any cause which might cause 
        that serve of his, nevertheless he thinks he has a point to make when he 
        says the sort of thing which the minds of all reject and repudiate.</p>

        himself at one and the same time to two things that cannot be proved: 
        first that something should happen without a cause, from which it will 
        follow that something comes from nothing, which neither he himself nor 
        any natural philosopher accepts; and second that, when two indivisible

		that the motion of change is a particular form of transitional motion; 
		for the composite object which changes in quality changes owing to the 
		local and transitional motion of the rationally perceived bodies which

		and take up different positions; that this could not be brought about in 
		any other way than by the transitional motion of the molecules.&nbsp; And 
		again, in order that a thing may become soft from hard or hard from 
		soft, the parts whereof it is composed must move in place; for it is

        <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; ">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Now 
        Epicurus, despite the fact that he employs in his Physics elements 
        similar to those of Ascelpiades, still allows that iron is attracted by 
        the lodestone, and chaff by amber.&nbsp; He even tries to give the cause of 
        the phenomenon.&nbsp; His view is that the atoms which flow from the stone 
        are related in shape to those flowing from the iron, and so they become 
        easily interlocked with one another; thus it is that, after colliding 
        with each of the two compact masses (the stone and the iron) they then 
        rebound into the middle and so become entangled with each other, and 
        draw the iron after them.&nbsp; So far, then, as his hypotheses regarding 
        causation go, he is perfectly unconvincing; nevertheless, he does grant 
        that there is an attraction.&nbsp; Further, he says that it is on similar 
        principles that there occur in the bodies of animals the dispersal of 
        nutrient and the discharge of waste matter, as also the actions of 
        cathartic drugs.</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          Asclepiades, however, who viewed with suspicion the incredible 
          character of the cause mentioned, and who saw no other credible cause 
          on the basis of his supposed elements, shamelessly found his way out 
          by stating that nothing is in any way attracted by anything else.&nbsp; 
          Now, if he was dissatisfied with what Epicurus said, and had nothing 
          better to say himself, he ought to have refrained from making 
          hypotheses, and should have said that Nature is a constructive artist 
          and that the substance of things is always tending towards unity and 
          also towards alteration because its own parts act upon and are acted 
          upon by one another.&nbsp; For, if he had assumed this, it would not have 
          been difficult to allow that this constructive nature has powers which 
          attract appropriate and expel alien matter.&nbsp; For in no other way could 
          she be constructive, preservative of the animal, and eliminative of 
          its diseases, unless it be allowed that she conserves what his 
          appropriate and discharges what is foreign.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          But in this matter, too, Ascelpiades realized the logical sequence of 
          the principles he had assumed; he showed no scruples, however, in 
          opposing plain fact; he joins issue in this matter also, not merely 
          with all physicians, by with everyone else, and maintains that there 
          is no such thing as a crisis, or a critical day, and that nature does 
          absolutely nothing for the preservation of the animal.&nbsp; For his 
          constant aim is to follow out logical consequences and to upset 
          obvious fact, in this respect being opposed to Epicurus; for the 
          latter always affirmed the observed fact, although he gives an 
          ineffective explanation of it, saying that these small corpuscles 
          belonging to the lodestone rebound, and become entangled with other 
          similar particles of the iron, and that then, by means of this 
          entanglement (which cannot be seen anywhere) such a heavy substance as 
          iron is attracted.&nbsp; I fail to understand how anybody could believe 
          this.&nbsp; Even if we admit this, the same principle will not explain the 
          fact that, when the iron has another piece brought in contact with it, 
          this becomes attached to it.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          For what are we to say?&nbsp; That, indeed, some of the particles that flow 
          from the lodestone collide with the iron and then rebound back, and 
          that it is by these that the iron becomes suspended?&nbsp; That others 
          penetrate into it, and rapidly pass through it by way of its empty 
          channels?&nbsp; That these then collide with the second piece of iron and 
          are not able to penetrate it although they penetrated the first 
          piece?&nbsp; And that they then course back to the first piece and produce 
          entanglements like the former ones?</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          The hypothesis here becomes clearly refuted by its absurdity.&nbsp; As a 
          matter of fact, I have seen five writing-stylets of iron attached to 
          one another in a line, only the first one being in contact with the 
          lodestone, and the power being transmitted through it to the others.&nbsp; 
          Moreover, it cannot be said that if you bring a second stylet into 
          contact with the lower end of the first, it becomes held, attached, 
          and suspended, whereas, if you apply it to any other part of the side 
          it does not become attached.&nbsp; For the power of the lodestone is 
          distributed in all directions; it merely needs to be in contact with 
          the first stylet at any point; from this stylet again the power flows, 
          as quick as thought, all through the second, and from that again to 
          the third.&nbsp; Now, if you imagine a small lodestone hanging in a house, 
          and in contact with it all round a large number of pieces of iron, 
          form them again others, from these others, and so on, all these pieces 
          of iron must surely become filled with the corpuscles which emanate 
          from the stone; therefore, this first little stone is likely to become 
          dissipated by disintegrating into these emanations.&nbsp; Further, even if 
          there be no iron in contact with it, it still disperses into the air, 
          particularly if this be also warm.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          “Yes,” says Epicurus, “but these corpuscles must be looked on as 
          exceedingly small, so that some of them are a ten-thousandth part of 
          the size of the very small particles carried in the air.”&nbsp; Then do you 
          venture to say that so great a weight of iron can be suspended by such 
          small bodies?&nbsp; If each of them is a ten-thousandth part as large as 
          the dust particles which are borne in the atmosphere, how big must we 
          suppose the hook-like extremities by which they interlock with each 
          other to be?&nbsp; For of course this is quite the smallest portion of the 
          whole particle.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          Then, again, when a small body becomes entangled with another small 
          body, or when a body in motion becomes entangled with another also in 
          motion, they do not rebound at once.&nbsp; For, further, there will of 
          course be others which break in upon them from above, from below, from 
          front and rear, from right to left, and which shake and agitate them 
          and never let them rest.&nbsp; Moreover, we would be forced to suppose that 
          each of these small bodies has a large number of these hook-like 
          extremities.&nbsp; For by one it attaches itself to its neighbors, by 
          another – the topmost one – to the lodestone, and by the bottom one to 
          the iron.&nbsp; For if it were attached to the stone above and not 
          interlocked with the iron below, this would be of no use.&nbsp; Thus, the 
          upper part of the superior extremity must hang from the lodestone and 
          the iron must be attached to the lower end of the inferior extremity; 
          and, since they interlock with each other by their sides as well, they 
          must, of course, have hooks there too.&nbsp; Keep in mind also, above 
          everything, what small bodies these are which possess all these 
          different kids of outgrowths.&nbsp; Moreover, remember how, in order that 
          the second piece of iron may become attached to the first, the third 
          to the second, and to that the fourth, these absurd little particle 
          must both penetrate the passages in the first piece of iron and at the 
          same time rebound from the piece coming next in the series, although 
          this second peeve is naturally in every way similar to the first.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          Such a hypothesis, once again, is certainly not lacking in audacity; 
          in fact, to tell the truth, it is far more shameless than the previous 
          ones; according to it, when five similar pieces of iron are arranged 
          in a line, the particles of the lodestone which easily traverse the 
          first piece of iron rebound from the second, and do not pass readily 
          through it in the same way.&nbsp; Indeed, it is nonsense, whichever 
          alternative is adopted.&nbsp; For, if they do rebound, how then do they 
          pass through into the third piece?&nbsp; And if they do not rebound, how 
          does the second piece become suspended to the first?&nbsp; For Epicurus 
          himself regarded the rebound as the active agent in the attraction.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          But, as I have said, one is driven to talk nonsense whenever one gests 
          into discussion with such men.&nbsp; Having, therefore, given a concise and 
          summary statement of the matter, I wish to be done with it.&nbsp; For if 
          one diligently familiarizes oneself with the writings of Ascelpiades, 
          one will see clearly their logical dependence on his first principles, 
          but also their disagreement with observed facts.&nbsp; Thus, Epicurus, in 
          his desire to adhere to the facts, cuts an awkward figure by aspiring 
          to show that these agree with his principles.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
          …<b>&nbsp; 15.59:</b> How, then, do they {kidneys} exert this 
          attraction {pulling waste from the blood}.&nbsp; If, as Epicurus thinks, 
          all attraction takes place by virtue of the <i>rebounds</i> and <i>
          entanglements</i> of the atoms, it would be certainly better to 
          maintain that the kidneys have no attractive action at all; for his 
          theory, when examined, would be found as it stands to be much more 
          ridiculous even than the theory of the lodestone, mentioned a little 
          while ago.</p>

        </font>So the world was compounded and endowed with its bent {i.e., <i>
        rounded</i>} shape in the following manner:&nbsp; Because atomic bodies, 
        which move without guidance and in a haphazard manner, were constantly 
        moving at the greatest of speeds, many bodies happened to be assembled 
        together in the same place, and thereby had variety of shapes and seizes 
        &lt;and weights&gt;.&nbsp; As they assembled in the same place, the larger and 
        heavier bodies tended to move toward the bottom and settled; but the 
        small, round, smooth, and slippery ones were pushed out in the concourse 
        of atoms and so moved into the celestial regions.&nbsp; So when the force of 
        the blows [of atomic collisions] stopped raising them up, and the blows 
        no longer carried them into the celestial regions, they were still 
        prevented from falling down because they were squeezed into places that 
        could accommodate them.&nbsp; Now these were situated all around, and most of 
        the bodies were bent around to these places.&nbsp; By becoming entangled with 
        each other during the bending, they generated the sky.&nbsp; Retaining the 
        same nature and being varied, as was said, the atoms which were pushed 
        out to the celestial regions produced the nature of the heavenly bodies. 
        The majority of the bodies which were evaporated upwards struck the air 
        and compressed it.&nbsp; And the air, being made wind-like during its 
        movement and gathering together the heavenly bodies, drove them around 
        with itself and by this twisting produced their present circular 
        movement in the celestial regions.&nbsp; And then the earth was produced from 
        the bodies which settled at the bottom, while those which were raised 
        upwards produced the sky, fire, and air.&nbsp; Since a great deal of matter 
        was still contained in the earth and this was packed densely by the 
        blows of the atomic bodies and by those from the rays of the heavenly 
        bodies, the earth’s entire configuration, which was made up of small 
        particles, was squeezed together and so produced the nature of fluids.&nbsp; 
        And since this nature was disposed to flow, it moved down into the 
        hollow places and those able to receive it and contain it; either that, 
        or the water all by itself hollowed out the existing places by settling 
        there.&nbsp; So the most important parts of the world were produced in this 
        way.</p>

        Why then does he not deride has master too, who did this very thing as 
        often as he wrote or spoke about the constitution of the soul and the 
        “initiation of the aggregate.”&nbsp; For if (as they themselves hold) the 
        combination of the two parts, a body of a certain description and a 
        soul, is man, then one who seeks to discover the nature of the soul is 
        seeking to discover the nature of man, starting from the more important 
        source.&nbsp; And that the soul is hard to apprehend by reason and cannot be 
        discerned by sense let us not learn from Socrates, “the sophist and 
        charlatan,” but from these sages, who get as far as those powers of the 
        soul that affect the flesh, by which it imparts warmth and softness and 
        firmness to the body, when they manufacture its substance by the 
        combining their own varieties of heat, gas and air, but quite before 
        they reach the seat of power.&nbsp; For its ability to judge, remember, love, 
        and hate – in short, its thinking and reasoning faculty – is added to 
        these, they say from a quality “that has no name.”&nbsp; This talk of the 
        thing “that has no name” is, we know, a confession of an embarrassed 
        ignorance – what they cannot make out they assert that they cannot 
        name.&nbsp; But let this too “be excused,” as they say.</p>

        explanation, continued Ammonius, was rather that voices are more 
        sonorous at night and preserve not only their volume but the precise 
        articulation. ...&nbsp; <b>2. p. 720F:</b> Boëthus then said that when he was 
        still young and occupied with academic pursuits, he had been accustomed 
        to using postulates and adopting unproved assumptions, after the manner 
        of geometry, but that he would now employ some of the demonstrated 
        doctrines of Epicurus.&nbsp; “Existing things move about in the 
        non-existent.&nbsp; There is a great deal of void interspersed and mingled 
        with the atoms of air.&nbsp; Now when air is dispersed and has scope and 
        motility because of its loose structure, the empty spaces left between 
        the particles are small and narrow and the atoms, being scattered, fill 
        a good deal of space, but when it is compressed and the atoms are 
        crowded into a small space, and are forced close together, they leave 
        plenty of space outside and make the intervals large.&nbsp; This is what 
        happens at night, under the influence of cold.&nbsp; For warmth loosens and 
        separates and dissolves concentrations, which is why bodies when boiling 
        or softening or melting take up more room, while on the other hand the 
        particles in freezing and cooling bodies join together more compactly 
        and leave vacuums – spaces from which they have withdrawn – in the 
        vessels which hold them.&nbsp; A sound which approaches and strikes a large 
        number of particles collected in a mass is either silenced completely or 
        undergoes serious convulsions and many collisions and delays. &nbsp;But in an 
        empty stretch, devoid of atoms, it travels a smooth, continuous, and 
        unimpeded path to the organ of hearing, preserving, by its velocity, not 
        only the sense of the message but its fine detail.&nbsp; Surely you have 
        noticed that empty vessels when struck are more responsive and send the 
        sound a long way, and often the sound goes round and round and there is 
        much communication of it; but a vessel filled either with solid matter 
        or with some liquid becomes completely mute and soundless, since the 
        sound has no way or passage by which to go through.&nbsp; Of physical bodies 
        themselves, gold and stone, because of their compactness, are 
        weak-voiced and dull-sounding, and quickly extinguish sounds within 
        them, but bronze is melodious and vocal, because it has much empty space 
        within its structure and is light and fine in its spatial mass, not 
        constricted by crowding particles, but containing an abundance of 
        flimsy, yielding substance. &nbsp;This gives easy passage to other motions 
        and especially to sound, receiving it hospitably and speeding it on its 
        journey, until someone, like a highway-robber, seizes and detains and 
        blindfolds it.&nbsp; There it comes to a halt, ceasing to move on because of 
        the obstruction.&nbsp; This is in my opinion what makes the night 
        sonorous and the day less so.&nbsp; Daytime, by its warmth, and the 
        expansion of the air, makes the intervals between the atoms small, so 
        long as no one objects to my basic assumptions.</p><b>

        There was no need to trouble the night with contraction and increased 
        tension of its air, so as to leave passages and vacuums elsewhere, as 
        through the air were a hindrance to sound or destroyed its substance.&nbsp; 
        Air is itself the substance and body and power of sound.&nbsp; Apart from 
        these points, turbulent nights, for example cloudy or stormy ones, ought 
        to be in your theory more sonorous than nights that are clear and 
        uniform in composition, because then the atoms are forced together in 
        one place, and leave the place they are driven from empty of matter.&nbsp; It 
        is also very obvious that a cold day would be more sonorous than a hot 
        summer night.&nbsp; But neither are true.</p><b>

        Favorinus … on this occasion advanced an old argument of Democritus.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Taking it down all blackened with smoke, as it were, he set about 
        cleaning and polishing it.&nbsp; He used for a foundation the familiar 
        argument found in Democritus that ghostly films penetrate the body 
        through the pores and that when they emerge they make us see things in 
        our sleep.&nbsp; These films that come to us emanate from everything – from 
        utensils, clothing, plants, and especially from animals, because of 
        their restlessness and their warmth.&nbsp; The films have not only the 
        impressed physical likeness in contour of an animal – so far Epicurus 
        agrees with Democritus, though he drops the subject at this stage – but 
        they gather and convey by attraction ghostly copies of each man’s mental 
        impulses, designs, moral qualities, and emotions.</p>

        Saint Augustine,<i> Letter to Dioscorus,</i> 118.27 t. II [p. 340B 
        Venice Edition 1719]:</b> How much better for me not even to have heard 
		the name of Democritus than to reflect with sorrow that someone was 
		considered great in his own times who thought that the gods were images 
		which were emitted from solid substances, although they themselves were 
		not solid, and that they, by circling around this way and that, of their 
		own motion, and by sliding into the minds of men, make them think the 
		image is a divine force, while the substance from which the image was 
		given off was deemed excellent in proportion to its solidity!&nbsp; 
		Therefore, his theory wavered, as they say, and varied, so that 
		sometimes, he said that a certain substance from which the images 
		streamed was god, yet, that substance cannot be conceived except through 
		the images which it emits and gives off, that is, those which come from 
		that substance, which he somehow thinks is corporeal and eternal and 
		therefore divine, while the images are carried long by a constant 
		emanation like mist, and they come and enter into ours so that we can 
		think they are a god or gods.&nbsp; Those philosophers hold that there is no 
		other cause for any thought of ours except these images which, when we 
		think, come form those substances and enter into our minds.&nbsp; …&nbsp; <b>28:</b>&nbsp; 
		However, Democritus is said to differ from Epicurus in his natural 
		philosophy, in that he thinks there is a certain living and breathing 
		force present at the coming together of atoms, by which force, I 
		believe, he says “the images are endowed with divinity” – not the images 
		of all things, but those of gods – and “that the elements from which the 
		mind is compounded” exist in the universe, and to these he attributes 
		divinity, and that these are “animate images which are wont to exercise 
		a beneficent or harmful influence over us.”&nbsp; But Epicurus postulated 
		nothing as the beginning of the world but atoms, that is, certain 
		particles of matter so minute that they cannot be divided or perceived 
		by either sight or touch, and by the chance meeting of these particles 
		he says that innumerable worlds, and living beings, and the principle of 
		life itself were produced, as well as the gods whom endows with human 
		form, and locates, not in any world, but beyond and between the worlds.&nbsp; 
		He refuses absolutely to consider anything but material substances, but, 
		in order to be able to think even about these, he says that images are 
		given off by the very things which he supposes to be formed by the 
		atoms, that they enter the mind, and that they are finer than the other 
		images which appear to the eyes – for he says that this is the cause of 
		our sight – but that they are “vast images of such a size as to envelop 
		and enfold the entire world.”</p>

        What follows is of the school of Epicurus.&nbsp; He teaches that just as 
        there is no anger in God, so there is not even kindness.&nbsp; For since 
        Epicurus thought that to do evil or do harm was foreign to God (an 
        action which is generally spring from the emotion of anger), he also 
        took from Him beneficence because he saw it to be a consequence that, if 
        God possessed anger, He would have kindness also.&nbsp; “From this,” he says, 
        “he is blessed and incorrupt, because he cares for nothing, and he 
        neither has any concern himself, nor does he show it for another.”</p>

        Accordingly, then, if there is neither anger nor kindness in [God], 
        surely there is neither fear nor joy nor grief nor compassion.&nbsp; For 
        there is one plan for all the affections, one connected movement, which 
        cannot be in God.&nbsp; But if there is no affection in God, because whatever 
        is affected is a weakness, therefore, neither is there any care of 
        anything nor any providence in Him.&nbsp; The argument of [Epicurus] extends 
        only this far.&nbsp; He was silent about the other things which follow, 
        namely, that there is no care in Him nor providence, and, therefore, 
        that there is not any reflection nor any sense in Him, by which it comes 
        about that He does not exist at all.&nbsp; So when he had descended step by 
        step, he stopped on the last step because he then saw the precipice.&nbsp; 
        But what advantage is it to have kept silent and to have concealed the 
        danger?&nbsp; Necessity forced him to fall even against his will.</p>

        Since, therefore, there are good and evil things in human affairs … it 
        is of necessity that God is moved with reference to each.&nbsp; He is moved 
        to kindness when He sees just things done, and to wrath when He beholds 
        the unjust.&nbsp; But Epicurus is in opposition to us and he says: “If there 
        is in God movement of joy unto kindness and of hatred unto wrath, then 
        he must have both fear, and inclination, and desire, and the other 
        affections which belong to human feebleness.”&nbsp; But it is not necessary 
        that he who is angry should also fear, or that he who rejoices should 
        grieve. &nbsp;… The affection of fear is a matter in man
        <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">– not in

        So the arguments are found to be empty&nbsp; … of those who think that there 
        is no movement of the mind in God.&nbsp; Because there are some affections 
        which do not happen to be found in God, like desire, fear, avarice, 
        grief, and envy, they have said that He is utterly free from all 
        affection.&nbsp; He is free of these because they are affections of vices; 
        but, those which are of virtue (that is, anger toward the evil, love 
        toward the good, compassion for the afflicted) since they are becoming

        Lactantius, <i>Divine Instituions, </i>III.17.8:</b> Epicurus saw that 
        adversities were always befalling the good: poverty, labors, exiles, and 
        loss of dear ones; that the evil on the contrary were happy, were 
        gaining in wealth, and were given honors.&nbsp; He saw that innocence was not 
        safe, that crimes were committed with impunity; he saw that death raged 
        without concern for morals, without any order or regard for years, but 
        that some reached old age, while others were snatched away in childhood; 
        some still robust reach the end, but others are cut off by untimely 
        deaths in the first flower of adolescence; and in wars the better ones 
        are conquered and die.&nbsp; It was especially disturbing, however, that 
        religious men were among the first to be afflicted with the more serious 
        evils, but upon those who either neglected the gods entirely or who did 
        not piously revere them, either lesser disadvantages came or none at 
        all.&nbsp; Often, also, the very temples were struck with lighting.&nbsp; {Cf. 
        Lucretius, II.1101}&nbsp; … <b>17.16:</b> When, therefore, Epicurus thought 
        on these matters, as if influenced by the iniquity of those things, for 
        so it seemed to one not knowing the cause and reason, he believed that 
        there was no providence.&nbsp; When he had persuaded himself of this theory, 
        he even undertook that it should be defended.&nbsp; Thus he cast himself into 
        inextricable errors.&nbsp; For if there is no providence, how was the world 
        made so orderly, by its arrangement?&nbsp; “There is no arrangement,” he 
        says, “for many things have been done differently from the way they 
        should have been.” {Cf. Lucretius, II.180 &amp; V.195}&nbsp; And a godlike man 
        discovered what he should reprehend.&nbsp; If there were time to refute each 
        single thing, I would show easily that this man was neither wise nor 
        sane.&nbsp; Likewise, if there is no providence, how are bodies of animals so 
        ordered that each of the members disposed in a marvelous arrangement 
        preserves its own functions?&nbsp; He says: “The plan of providence has done 
        nothing in the procreating of animals.&nbsp; Neither were the eyes made for 
        seeing, nor the ears for hearing, nor the tongue for speaking, nor the 
        feet for walking, since these were in existence before there was seeing, 
        hearing, speaking, and walking.&nbsp;&nbsp; So these things were not produced for 
        use, but the use came from them.&nbsp; {Cf. Lucretius IV.822}&nbsp; If there is no 
        providence, why do the rains fall, grains rise, trees flower?&nbsp; He says 
        that “those are not for the sake of living things, since they are of no 
        profit to providence, but all things must happen of their own accord.”&nbsp; 
        Whence, therefore, are they born, or how do all things which happen come 
        to be?&nbsp; He says that it is not the work of providence.&nbsp; “There are seeds 
        flying about through the void, and when these have massed together at 
        random among themselves, all things are born and grow.”</p>

        governed by no providence.&nbsp; They assign the origin of things to 
        inseparable and solid bodies from the chance combinations of which all 
        things come to be and have arisen.&nbsp; I pass by the things pertaining to 
        the world itself with which they find fault; in this they are mad, even 
        to the point of ridicule.&nbsp; I take up now that which pertains to the

        come forth from the womb, they are able at once to stand erect and move 
        about with delight, and they are at once able to endure the air because 
        they have come forth into the light fortified by natural protections.&nbsp; 
        Man, on the other hand, they claim, is cast forth naked and unarmed as 
        from a shipwreck and is hurled upon the miseries of this life.&nbsp; he is 
        able neither to move himself from the place where he has been put forth, 
        nor to seek the nourishment of milk, nor to bear the brunt of weather.&nbsp; 
        So they say that nature is not the mother of the human race, but a 
        stepmother.&nbsp; She has been very liberal with the dumb beasts, but she has 
        produced man in such a way – needy and weak – and in want of all aid he 
        can do nothing else by indicate his condition by wailing and weeping, 
        that is “as one for whom there remains in life only the passage of 
        evils.” {Lucretius, V.227} … <b>3.6:</b> “But the training of man,” they 
        say, “consists of great struggle.”&nbsp; <b>4.1:</b> Then too, people 
        complain that man is subjected to sickness and untimely death.&nbsp; They are 
        incensed, in fact, that they have not been born gods.&nbsp; “Not at all,” 
        they will say, “but from this we demonstrate that man was not made with 
        any providence, and it should have been otherwise.” ... <b>4.3:</b> 
        They, mind you, would have no man die except when he has completed a 
        hundred years of life.&nbsp;... <b>4.12:</b> Our opponents do not see the 
        reason of the outcomes, because they erred once in the very keypoints of 
        this discussion. &nbsp;For when divine providence was excluded from human 
        affairs, it necessarily followed that all things came into being of 
        their own accord.&nbsp; From this stage, they hit upon those impacts and 
        chance comings together of minute seeds, because they saw no origin of 
        things.&nbsp; And when they had cast themselves into these straits, then, 
        sheer necessity forced them to think that souls were born with their 
        bodies and were also extinguished with them.&nbsp; They had taken it for 
        granted that nothing was done by a divine mind.&nbsp; And this very point 
        they could not prove in any other way than by showing that there were 
        some things in which the determination of Providence seemed to limp.&nbsp; 
        They found fault, therefore, with those things in which Providence 
        marvelously, even exceptionally, expressed in divinity, namely, those 
        things I have referred to concerning sicknesses and untimely death, 
        although they should have considered, when they were assuming these

        Cicero, <i>On End-Goals, Good and Bad,</i> II.10.31: </b>For the 
        origin of the Chief Good, he {Epicurus} goes back, I understand, to the 
        birth of living things.&nbsp; As soon as an animal is born, it delights 
        in pleasure and seeks it as a good, but shuns pain as an evil.&nbsp; 
        Creatures as yet uncorrupted are according to him the best judges of 
        Good and Evil... <b>33:</b> For proof of this, however, Epicurus cannot 
        have gone to children nor yet to animals, which according to him hold a 
        mirror up to nature; he could hardly say that natural instinct guides 
        the young to desire the pleasure of freedom from pain.&nbsp; This cannot 
        excite sexual desire; the ‘static’ condition of feeling no pain exerts 
        no driving-power, supplies no impulse to the will (so that Hieronymus 
        also is wrong here); it is the positive sensation of pleasure and 
        delight that furnishes a motive. Accordingly Epicurus’ standing argument 
        to prove that pleasure is naturally desired is that infants and animals 
        are attracted by the ‘kinetic’ sort of pleasure, not the ‘static’ kind 
        which consists merely in freedom from pain.</p>

        Cicero, <i>Tusculan Disputations,</i> III.13.28: </b>Epicurus holds that 
        the distress which the idea of evil produces is a natural effect, in the 
        sense that anyone who contemplates some considerable evil at once feels 
        distress, should he imagine that it has befallen him.</p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
        <i>Ibid.,</i> III.15.32: </b>Epicurus supposes that all men must 
        necessarily feel distress if they think themselves encompassed by evils, 
        whether previously foreseen and anticipated, or long established. For 
        according to him, evils are not lessened by duration nor lightened by 
        previous consideration, and besides, he thinks it folly to dwell upon an 
        evil which has still to come or maybe will not come at all; all evil, he 
        says, is hateful enough when it has come, but the man who is always 
        thinking a mishap may come is making that evil perpetual. But if it is 
        not destined to come at all, he is needlessly the victim of a 
        wretchedness he has brought upon himself; thus he is always tortured 
        either by undergoing or by reflecting on the evil.<b> 33: </b>
        Alleviation of distress, however, Epicurus finds in two directions, 
        namely in calling the soul away from reflecting upon vexation and in a 
        “recall” to the consideration of pleasures. For he thinks the soul able 
        to obey reason and follow its guidance. Reason therefore (in his view) 
        forbids attention to vexations, withdraws the soul from morose 
        reflections, blunts its keenness in dwelling upon wretchedness and, 
        sounding a retreat from such thoughts, eagerly urges it on again to 
        discover a variety of pleasures and engage in them with all the powers 
        of the mind; and according to this philosopher the wise man’s life is 
        packed with the recollection of past and the prospect of future 
        pleasures. This view we have stated in our usual style, the Epicureans 
        state it in theirs. But let us look at their meaning – let us ignore 
        their style.</p>

        experienced from luxury comes nowhere near the pleasure experienced from 
        self-sufficiency; it is very pleasant to think just how little one 
        needs.&nbsp; Take away luxury, take away sexual excitement and the desire for 
        external recognition, and what further need is there for inert wealth, 
        which is useful to us for nothing but only weighs us down?&nbsp; This is the 
        way to be filled full, and the pleasure from this kind of satiety is 
        unmixed.&nbsp; We must also make the body unaccustomed, so far as is 
        possible, to the pleasures of excess, but accustomed to the fulfillment 
        which comes from satisfying hunger; we must eat in order to get through 
        everything, and must take as our limit not the unlimited, but the 
        necessary.&nbsp; Thus it too, by self-sufficiency and assimilation to the 
        divine, can obtain the good that is possible for it.&nbsp; Thus it will be 
        genuinely rich, measuring its wealth by the natural limit, not by empty 
        beliefs.&nbsp; Thus it will not be suspended on hopes of the greatest 
        pleasure, without being sure of getting it; for that pleasure causes 
        maximum disruption.&nbsp; But it will be self-sufficient in what is present 
        and in what has already happened, and will not be tormented by the 
        thought of not remaining for longer.</p>

        school because it will not authorize complete assurance, it should not

        should be used to handle such matters, and it will immediately turn out 
        that pursuing a minimal, simple and light diet is far better; for least 
        disturbance comes from least.&nbsp; Preparing food brings many impediments in

        pleased me today.&nbsp; It too is culled from another man’s Garden: “Poverty, 
        brought into conformity with the law of nature, is great wealth.”&nbsp; Do 
        you know what limits that law of nature ordains for us?&nbsp; Merely to avert 
        hunger, thirst, and cold.&nbsp; … &nbsp;Nature’s needs are easily provided and

        in its very shortness.&nbsp; For no great pain lasts long.&nbsp; And at all

        being torn asunder, even though the profess be accompanied by 
        excruciating pain, in the thought that after this pain is over he can 
        feel no more pain.&nbsp; I am sure, however, that an old man’s soul is on his 
        very lips, and that only a little force is necessary to disengage it 
        from the body.&nbsp; A fire which has seized upon a substance that sustains 
        it needs water to quench it, or sometimes, the destruction of the 
        building itself; but the fire which lacks sustaining fuel dies away of 
        its own accord.”&nbsp;&nbsp; … <b>16:</b> Bassus kept saying: “It is due to our

        when we believe that our end is near at hand.”&nbsp; But who is not near 
        death?&nbsp; It is ready for us in all places and at all times.&nbsp; “Let us 
        consider,” he went on to say, “when some agency of death seems imminent, 
        how much nearer are other varieties of dying, which are not feared by 
        us.”&nbsp; A man is threatened with death by an enemy, but this form of death

        Cicero, <i>Tusculan Disputations,</i> V.38.110:</b> Emotions of the 
        soul, anxieties and distresses are alleviated by forgetfulness when the 
        thoughts of the soul are diverted to pleasure.&nbsp; Not without reason 
        therefore, Epicurus ventured to say that the Sage always has more of 
        good than evil because he always has pleasures; and from this he thinks 
        there follows the conclusion we are in search of: that the Sage is 
        always happy.&nbsp; <b>111:</b> “Even if he is to go without the sense of 
        sight, or of hearing?”&nbsp; Even then – for he doesn’t love such things for 
        themselves.&nbsp; For to begin with, what pleasures, pray tell, does the 
        blindness you dread so much have to go without? &nbsp;Seeing that some even 
        argue that all the other pleasures reside in the actual sensations, 
        while the perceptions of sight do not go along with any delight felt in 
        the eyes, in the same way as the perceptions of taste, smell, touch, 
        hearing are confided to the actual organ of sensation – nothing of the 
        sort takes place with the eyes.&nbsp; It is the soul which receives the 
        objects we see.&nbsp; Now the soul may have delight in may different ways, 
        even without the use of sight; for I am speaking of an educated and 
        instructed man with whom life is thought; and the thought of the wise 
        man scarcely ever calls in the support of the eyes to aid his 
        researches.&nbsp; For if night does not put a stop to happy life, why should 
        a day that resembles night stop it?&nbsp; … <b>39.114:</b> Democritus lost 
        his sight – he could not, to be sure, distinguish blank from white; but 
        all the same he could distinguish good from bad, just from unjust, 
        honorable from disgraceful, expedient from inexpedient, great from 
        small, and it allowed him to live happily without seeing changes of 
        color; it was not possible to do so without true ideas.&nbsp; And this man 
        believed that the sight of the eyes was an obstacle to the piercing 
        vision of the soul and, while others often failed to see what lay at 
        their feet, he ranged freely into the infinite without finding any 
        boundary that brought him to a halt. <b> 
          &nbsp;40, 116: </b>Is there any evil really in deafness?&nbsp; … all of us 
        ... are assuredly deaf in so many foreign languages which we do not 
        understand.&nbsp; “But the deaf do not hear the voice of a good singer.”&nbsp; No, 
        nor the screech of a saw either, when it is being sharpened, nor the 
        grunting of a pig when its throat is being cut, nor the thunder of the 
        roaring sea when they want to sleep.&nbsp; And if, perhaps, music has charms 
        for them, they should first reflect that many wise men lived happily 
        before music was invented, secondly, that far greater pleasure can be 
        derived from reading than hearing verse. Next, as a little while ago we 
        diverted the blind to the pleasure of hearing, so we may divert the deaf 
        to the pleasure of sight; for the man who can converse with himself will 
        not need the conversation of another.</p><b>

        unpleasant, difficult, horrible, contrary to nature, and yet that it is 
        not an evil.&nbsp; Epicurus, who says that pain is the only evil and the 
        worst of all evils, thinks that the Sage will call it sweet.&nbsp; For my 
        part I do not require you to describe pain in the same words as 
        Epicurus, that devotee, as you know, of pleasure.&nbsp; Let him, if he likes, 
        say the same inside the bull of Phalaris as he would have said, had he

        Cicero, <i>Tusculan Disputations,</i> V.26.73: </b>Is Epicurus, who 
        merely puts on the mask of a philosopher and has bestowed the title on 
        himself, to be allowed to say … that there is no circumstance in which 
        the Sage, even if burnt, racked, cut into pieces, cannot cry out: “I 
        count it all as nothing” – particularly as Epicurus restricts evil to 
        pain and good to pleasure, makes a mockery of our notions of <i>virtuous</i> 
        and <i>depraved</i> and says we are preoccupied with words and uttering 
        sounds empty of meaning, and that nothing interests us except the bodily 
        sensation of either rough or smooth.&nbsp; Shall we allow this man …. to be 
        forgetful of himself and be disdainful of fortune at the moment when all 
        that he holds good and evil is at fortune's disposal?&nbsp; <b>75: </b>…he 
        maintains that the Sage is always happy.</p>

        “revel in it” and “hymn the praises” of their own “way of living.”&nbsp;
