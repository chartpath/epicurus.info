<p align="justify"><img src="latinspring.jpg" VSPACE="4" ALIGN="RIGHT" width="345" height="663"><a NAME="VI"></a><b>VI.</b> &#133;It was the Latin festival, and I had come at
Cotta&#146;s express invitation to pay him a visit. I found him sitting in an alcove,
engaged in debate with Gaius Velleius, a member of the Senate, held by the Epicureans as
their chief Roman adherent at the time. With them was Quintus Lucilius Balbus, who was so
accomplished a student of Stoicism as to rank with the leading Greek exponents of that
system.</p>
<p align="justify">When Cotta saw me, he greeted me with the words: &quot;You come exactly at the right
moment, for I am just engaging in a dispute with Velleius on an important topic, in which
you will be interested&#151;with your tastes&#151;to take part.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify"><b>VII. </b>&quot;Well,&quot; I replied, &quot;I too think I have come at the right
moment, as you say. For here you are, three leaders of three schools of philosophy, joined
in congress. In fact, we only lack Marcus Piso to have every considerable school
represented.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Oh,&quot; rejoined Cotta, &quot;if what is said in the book which our master
Antiochus lately dedicated to our good Balbus here is true, you have no need to regret the
absence of your friend Piso. Antiochus holds the view that the doctrines of the Stoics,
though differing in form of expression, agree in substance with those of the Peripatetics.
I should like to know your opinion of the book, Balbus.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;My opinion?&quot; said Balbus, &quot;Why, I am surprised that a man of first-rate
intellect like Antiochus should have failed to see what a gulf divides the Stoics, who
distinguish <i>expediency</i> and <i>right</i> not in name only but in essential nature,
from the Peripatetics, who class the right and the expedient together, and only recognize
differences of quantity or degree, not of kind, between them. This is not a slight verbal
discrepancy, but a fundamental difference of doctrine. However, we can discuss this some
other time. For the moment, if you please, we will continue the topic which we had
begun.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Agreed,&quot; answered Cotta; &quot;but to let the newcomer know what is the
subject at hand&quot;&#151;here he glanced at me&#151;&quot;I must explain that we were
debating the nature of the gods: a question which seemed to me, as it always does, an
extremely obscure one, and upon which I was therefore inquiring of Velleius as to the
opinion of Epicurus. So if you do not mind, Velleius,&quot; he continued, &quot;please
resume the exposition that you had begun.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;I will do so,&quot; replied Velleius, &quot;although it is not I but you who have
been reinforced by an ally&#151;since both of you,&quot; he said, with a smile in our
direction, &quot;are disciples of Philo, and have learned from him to know nothing.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;What we have learned,&quot; I rejoined, &quot;shall be Cotta&#146;s affair; but
pray don&#146;t think I have come to act as his ally, but as a listener, and an impartial
and unprejudiced listener too, under no sort of bond nor obligation whatsoever to uphold
some fixed opinion.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="VIII"></a><b>VIII.</b>&nbsp;<a NAME="18"></a>Hereupon Velleius began, in the
confident manner (I need not say) that is customary with Epicureans, afraid of nothing so
much as lest he should appear to have doubts about anything. One would have supposed he
had just come down from the assembly of the gods in the <i>intermundane</i> spaces of
Epicurus! </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;I am not going to expound to you doctrines that are mere baseless figments of the
imagination, such as the artisan deity and world-builder of Plato&#146;s <i>Timaeus</i>,
or that old hag of a fortune teller, the Providence of the Stoics; nor yet a world endowed
with a mind and senses of its own, a spherical, rotary god of burning fire; these are the
marvels and monstrosities of philosophers who do not reason but dream. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;What power of mental vision enabled your master Plato to discern the vast and
elaborate architectural process which, as he makes out, the deity adopted in building the
structure of the universe? What method of engineering was employed? What tools and levers
and derricks? What agents carried out so vast an undertaking? And how were air, fire,
water and earth enabled to obey and execute the will of the architect? How did the five
regular solids<a HREF="#*"><sup>*</sup></a> which are the bases of all other forms of matter, come
into existence so nicely adapted to make impressions on our minds and produce sensations?
It would be a lengthy task to premeditate upon every detail of a system that seems to be
the result of idle theorizing rather than of real research; but the prize example is that
the thinker who represented the world not merely as having had an origin but, although
made by hand, also declared that it will exist forever. Can you suppose that this man
could even dip into natural philosophy if he imagines that anything that has come into
being can be eternal? What composite whole is not capable of dissolution? What thing is
there that has a beginning but not an end? </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;And as for your Stoic Providence, Lucilius, if it is the same thing as
Plato&#146;s creator, I repeat my previous questions, what were its agents and
instruments, and how was the entire undertaking planned out and carried though? If, on the
contrary, it is something different, I ask why it made the world mortal, and not
everlasting as did Plato&#146;s divine creator? </p>

<p align="justify"><b>IX.</b> &quot;Moreover, I would put the question to both of you, why did these
deities suddenly awake into activity as world-builders after countless ages of slumber?
For though the world did not exist, it does not follow that ages did not exist (meaning by
ages, not periods made up of a number of days and nights in annual courses&#151;for ages
in this sense, I admit, could not have been produced without the circular motion of the
heavens) but from the infinite past there has existed an eternity not measured by limited
divisions of time, but of a nature intelligible in terms of extension; since it is
inconceivable that there was ever a time when time did not exist. Well then,
Balbus, what
I ask is, why did your Providence remain idle all though that extent of time of which you
speak? Was it in order to avoid fatigue? But a god cannot know fatigue; and also there was
no fatigue in question, since all the elements, sky, fire, earth, and sea, were obedient
to the divine will. Also, why should a god take a fancy to decorate the heavens with
figures and illuminations, like an aedile<a HREF="#**"><sup>**</sup></a>? If it was to embellish his
own abode, then it seems that he had previously been dwelling for an infinite time in a
dark and gloomy hovel! And are we to suppose that thenceforward, the varied beauties which
we see adorning the earth and sky have afforded him pleasure? How could a god take
pleasure in things of this sort? And if he did, he could not have dispensed with it so
long. Or were these beauties designed for the sake of men, as your school usually
maintains? For the sake of wise men? If so, all this vast effort of construction took
place on account of a handful of people. For the sake of fools then? But in the first
place, there was no reason for a god to do a service to the wicked; and secondly, what
good did he do?&#151;inasmuch as all fools are beyond question extremely miserable,
precisely because they are fools (for what can be more miserable than folly?), and in the
second place, because there are so many troubles in life that, though wise men can assuage
them by balancing against them life&#146;s advantages, fools can neither avoid their
approach nor endure their presence. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Those on the other hand who said that the world is itself endowed with life and
with consciousness, failed entirely to discern what shape the nature of an intelligent
living being could conceivably possess. I will touch on this a little later; for the
present, I will confine myself to expressing my surprise at their stupidity in holding
that a being who is immortal and also blessed is of a spherical shape, merely on the
ground that Plato pronounces a sphere to be the most beautiful of all figures. As for
myself, on the score of appearance I prefer either a cylinder or a cube or a cone or a
pyramid. Then, what mode of existence is assigned to their spherical deity? Why, he is in
a state of rotation, spinning around with a velocity that surpasses all powers of
conception. But what room can there be in such an existence for stability of mind and for
happiness&#151;I cannot see. Also, why should a condition that is painful in the human
body, if even the smallest part of it is affected, be supposed to be painless in the
deity? Now clearly the earth, being a part of the world, is also a part of the god. Yet we
see that vast portions of the earth&#146;s surface are uninhabitable deserts, being either
scorched by the sun&#146;s proximity, or frost-bound and covered with snow owing to its
extreme remoteness. But if the world is god, these, being parts of the world, must be
regarded as limbs of the god, undergoing the extremes of heat and cold respectively. ~ </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XVI"></a><b>XVI. </b>&quot;I have given a rough account of what are more like
the dreams of madmen than the carefully thought-out opinions of philosophers. For they are
barely less absurd than the outpourings of the poets, harmful as these have been owing to
the mere charm of their style. The poets have represented the gods as inflamed by anger
and maddened by lust, and have displayed to our gaze their wars and battles, their fights
and wounds, their hatreds, animosity, and quarrels, their births and deaths, their
complaints and lamentations, the utter and unbridled license of their passions, their
adulteries and imprisonments, their unions with human beings and the birth of mortal
progeny from an immortal parent.&nbsp;<a NAME="43"></a>Along with the errors of the poets
we may include the monstrous doctrines of the <i>magi</i> and the insane mythology of
Egypt, and also the popular beliefs, which are a mere mass of inconsistencies springing
from ignorance. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Anyone pondering on the baseless and irrational character of these doctrines
ought to regard Epicurus with reverence, and to rank him as one of the very gods about
whom we are inquiring<a HREF="#***"><sup>***</sup></a>. For he alone perceived, first, that the gods
exist, because nature herself has imprinted a conception of them on the minds of all
mankind. For what nation or what tribe of men is there but possesses untaught some
&#145;preconception&#146; of the gods? Such notions Epicurus designates by the word <i>prolepsis</i>,
that is, a sort of preconceived mental picture of a thing, without which nothing can be
understood or investigated or discussed. The force and value of this argument we learn in
that work of genius, Epicurus&#146; <i>Criterion of Judgment</i>. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>XVII.</b> &quot;You see, therefore, that the foundation (for such it is) of inquiry
has been well and truly laid. For the belief in the gods has not been established by
authority, custom, or law, but rests on the unanimous and abiding consensus of mankind;
their existence is therefore a necessary inference, since we possess an instinctive or
rather an innate concept of them; but a belief which all men by nature share must
necessarily be true; therefore, it must be admitted that the gods exist. And since this
truth is almost universally accepted not only among philosophers but also among the
unlearned, we must admit it as also being an accepted truth that we possess a
&#145;preconception,&#146; as I called it, or &#145;prior notion,&#146; of the gods. (For
we are bound to employ novel terms to denote novel ideas, just as Epicurus himself
employed the word <i>prolepsis</i> in a sense which no one had ever used before.) We have,
therefore, a preconception of such a nature that we believe the gods to be blessed and
immortal. Or nature, which bestowed upon us an idea of the gods themselves, also engraved
on our minds the belief that they are eternal and blessed. If this is so, the famous maxim
of Epicurus<a HREF="#[4]"><sup>[4]</sup></a> truthfully enunciates that &#145;that which is blessed
and eternal can neither know trouble itself nor cause trouble to another, and accordingly
cannot feel either anger or favor, since all such things belong only to the weak.&#146; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;If we sought to attain nothing else beside piety in worshipping the gods and
freedom from superstition, what has been said had sufficed; since the exalted nature of
the gods, being both eternal and supremely blessed, would receive man&#146;s pious worship
(for what is highest commands the reverence that is its due); and furthermore, all fear of
the divine power or divine anger would have been banished (since it is understood that
anger and favor alike are excluded from the nature of a being at once blessed and
immortal, and that these being eliminated we are menaced by no fears in regard to the
powers above). But the mind strives to strengthen this belief by trying to discover the
form of a god, the mode of his activity and the operation of his intelligence. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XVIII"></a><b>XVIII.</b> &quot;For the divine form we have the hints of nature
supplemented by the teachings of reason. All men of all races naturally derive the notion
of gods as having human shape and none other; for in what other shape do they ever appear
to anyone, awake or asleep? But not to make primary concepts the sole test of all things,
reason itself delivers the same pronouncement. For it seems appropriate that the being who
is the most exalted, whether by reason of his happiness or of his immortality, should also
be the most beautiful; but what disposition of the limbs, what cast of features, what
shape or outline can be more beautiful than the human form? You Stoics, at least,
Lucilius, (for my friend Cotta says one thing at one time and another at another)
habitually portray the skill of the divine creator by enlarging on the beauty as well as
the utility of design displayed in all parts of the human figure. But if the human figure
surpasses the form of all other living beings, and a god is a living being, then a god
must possess the shape which is the most beautiful of all; and since it is agreed that the
gods are supremely happy, and no one can be happy without virtue, and virtue cannot exist
without reason, and reason is only found in the human shape, it follows that the gods
possess the form of man. Yet their form is not corporeal, but only resembles bodily
substance; it does not contain blood, but the semblance of blood. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>XIX.</b> &quot;These discoveries of Epicurus are so acute in themselves and so
subtly expressed that not everyone would be capable of appreciating them. Still I may rely
on your intelligence, and make my exposition briefer than the subject demands. Epicurus
then, as he not merely discerns abstruse and obscure things with his mind&#146;s eye, but
handles them as tangible realities, teaches that the substance and nature of the gods is
such that, in the first place, it is perceived not by the senses but by the mind, and not
materially or individually, like the solid objects which Epicurus in virtue of their
substantiality entitles steremnia; but by our perceiving images owing to their similarity
and succession, because an endless train of precisely similar images arises from the
innumerable atoms and streams towards us from the gods, our mind with the keenest feelings
of pleasure fixes its gaze on these images, and so attains an understanding of the nature
of being both blessed and eternal. Moreover there is the supremely potent principle of
infinity, which claims the closest and most careful study; we must understand that it has
the following property, that in the sum of things, everything has its exact match and
counterpart. This property is termed by Epicurus <i>isonomia</i>, or the <i>principle of
uniform distribution</i>. From this principle it follows that if the whole number of
mortals be a certain number, then there must exist no less a number of immortals, and if
the causes of destruction are beyond count, then the causes of conservation also are bound
to be infinite. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;You Stoics are also found of asking us, Balbus, what is the mode of life of the
gods and how they pass their days. the answer is: their life is the happiest conceivable,
and the one most bountifully furnished with all good things. A god is entirely inactive
and free from all ties of occupation; he toils not neither does he labor, but he takes
delight in his own wisdom and virtue, and knows with absolute certainty that he will
always enjoy pleasures at once consummate and everlasting. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XX"></a><b>XX.</b>&nbsp;<a NAME="52"></a>&quot;This is the god whom we should
call happy in the proper sense of the term; your Stoic god seems to us to be grievously
overworked. If the world itself is god, what can be less restful than to revolve at
incredible speed around the axis of the heavens without a single moment of respite? But
repose is an essential condition of happiness. If, on the other hand, some god resides
within the world as its governor and pilot, maintaining the courses of the stars, the
changes of the seasons and all the ordered process of creation, and keeping a watch on
land and sea to guard the interests of lives and men, why, what a bondage of irksome and
laborious business is his! </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;We, for our part, deem happiness to consist in tranquillity of mind and entire
exemption from all duties. For he who taught us all of our other teaching has also taught
us that the world was the product of nature, without needing an artificer to construct it,
and that the act of creation, which according to you cannot be performed without divine
skill, is so easy, that nature will create, is creating and has created worlds without
number. You, on the contrary, cannot see how nature can achieve all this without the aid
of some intelligence, and so, like the tragic poets, being unable to bring the plot of
your drama to a conclusion, you have resorted to a <i>deus ex machina</i>; whose
intervention you assuredly would not require if you would but contemplate the measureless
and boundless extent of space that stretches in every direction, into which when the mind
projects and propels itself, it journeys onward far and wide without ever sighting any
margin or ultimate point where it can stop. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Well then, in this immensity of length and breadth and height, there fits an
infinite quantity of atoms, which&#151;though separated by void&#151;cohere together, and
taking hold of one another, form unions from which are created those shapes and forms of
things which you think cannot be created without the aid of bellows and anvils, and so
have saddled us with an eternal master, whom day and night we are to fear; for who would
not fear a prying busybody of a god, who foresees, thinks of, and notices all things, and
deems that everything is his concern? An outcome of this theology was first of all you
doctrine of <i>Necessity</i> or <i>Fate</i>&#151;the theory that every event is the result
of an eternal truth and an unbroken sequence of causation. But what value can be assigned
to a philosophy which thinks that everything happens by fate? It is a belief for old
women, and ignorant old women at that! And next follows your doctrine of Divination, which
would so steep us in superstition, if we consented to listen to you, that we should be the
devotees of soothsayers, augurs, oracle-mongers, seers and interpreters of dreams. But
Epicurus has set us free from superstitious terrors and delivered us out of captivity, so
that we have no fear of beings who, we know, create no trouble for themselves and seek to
cause none to others, while we worship with pious reverence the transcendent majesty of
nature. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;But I fear that my enthusiasm for this subject has made me long-winded. It is
difficult, however, to leave such a vast and splendid theme unfinished, although really it
was not my business to be a speaker so much as a listener.&quot; </p>
