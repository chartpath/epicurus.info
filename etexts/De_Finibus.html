<p align="justify"><a NAME="V"></a><tt><img border="0" src="cicero.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" alt="Cicero" width="220" height="241"></tt><b>V.</b> To begin with what is easiest, let us first pass in review
the system of Epicurus, which to most men is the best known of any. Our exposition of it,
as you shall see, will be as accurate as any usually given even by the professed adherents
of his school. For our object is to discover the truth, not to refute someone as an
opponent. </p>

<p align="justify">An elaborate defense of hedonistic theory of Epicurus was once delivered by Lucius
Torquatus, a student well versed in all the systems of philosophy; to him I replied, and
Gaius Triarius, a youth of remarkable learning and seriousness of character, assisted at
the discussion. Both of these gentlemen had called to pay me their respects at my place at
Cumæ. We first exchanged a few remarks about literature, of which both were enthusiastic
students. </p>

<p align="justify">Then Torquatus said, &quot;As we have for once found you at leisure, I am resolved to
hear the reason why you regard my master Epicurus, not indeed with hatred, as those who do
not share his view mostly do, but at all events with disapproval. I myself consider him as
the one person who has discerned the Truth, and who has delivered men from the gravest
errors and imparted to them all there is to know about well-being and happiness. The fact
is, I think that you are like our friend Triarius, and dislike Epicurus because he has
neglected the graces of style that you find in you Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus. For
I can scarcely bring myself to believe that you think his opinions untrue.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Let me assure you, Torquatus,&quot; said I, &quot;that you are entirely mistaken.
With you master&#146;s style I have no fault to find. He expresses his meaning adequately,
and gives me a plain intelligible statement. Not that I despise eloquence in a philosopher
if he has to offer it, but I should not greatly insist on it if he has not. But his
material I do not find so satisfactory, and that in more points than one. However,
&#145;many men, many minds:&#146;<sup><a HREF="De_Finibus.html#1">[1]</a>  </sup> so it is possible
that I am mistaken.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;What is it, please,&quot; he asked, &quot;to which you take exception? For I
recognize you as a just critic, provided you really know what his doctrines are.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Oh,&quot; said I, &quot;I know the whole of Epicurus&#146; opinions well
enough&#151;unless you think that Phædrus or Zeno did not tell me the truth. I have heard
both of them lecture, though to be sure they convinced me of nothing but their own
devotion to the system. Indeed I regularly attended those professors, in company with our
friend Atticus, who for his part had an admiration for them both, and a positive affection
for Phædrus. Every day we used to discuss together in private what we had head at
lecture, and there was never any dispute as to what I could understand; the question was,
what I could accept as true.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="VI"></a><b>VI. </b>&quot;Well then, what is the point?&quot; said he; &quot;I
should very much like to know what it is that you disagree with.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Let me begin,&quot; I replied, &quot;with the subject of Natural Philosophy,
which is Epicurus&#146; particular boast. Here, in the first place, he is entirely
second-hand. His doctrines are those of Democritus, with a very few modifications. And as
for the latter, where he attempts to improve upon his original, in my opinion he only
succeeds in making things worse. Democritus believes in certain things which he terms
&#145;atoms,&#146; that is, bodies so solid as to be indivisible, moving about in a vacuum
of infinite extent, which has neither top, bottom nor middle, neither center nor
circumference. The motion of these atoms is such that they collide and so cohere together;
and from this process result the whole of the things that exist and that we see. Moreover,
this movement of the atoms must not be conceived as starting from a beginning, but as
having gone on from all eternity. Epicurus for his part, where he follows Democritus, does
not generally blunder. Still, there is a great deal in each of them with which I do not
agree, and especially this: in the study of Nature there are two questions to be asked,
first, what is the matter out of which each thing is made, second, what is the force by
which it is made; now Democritus and Epicurus have discussed the question of matter, but
they have not considered the question of force or the effective cause. But this is a
defect shared by both; I now come to the lapses peculiar to Epicurus. He believes that
these same indivisible solid bodies are borne by their own weight perpendicularly
downward, which he holds is the natural motion of all bodies; but thereupon this clever
fellow, being met with the difficulty that if they all traveled downwards in a straight
line, and, as I said, perpendicularly, no one atom would ever be able to overtake any
other atom, accordingly introduced an idea of his own invention: he said that the atom
makes a very tiny swerve&#151;the smallest divergence possible; and thus produces
entanglements and combinations and cohesion of atoms with atoms, which result in the
creation of the world, and all its parts, and of all that in them is. Now not only is this
whole affair a piece of childish fancy, but it does not even achieve the result that its
author desires. The swerving is itself an arbitrary fiction; for Epicurus says the atoms
swerve without cause&#151;yet this is the capital offense in a natural philosopher, to
speak of something taking place uncaused. Then also he gratuitously deprives the atoms of
what he himself declared to be the natural motion of all heavy bodies, namely, movement in
a straight line downwards, and yet he does not attain the object for the sake of which
this fiction was devised. For, if all the atoms swerve, none will ever come to cohere
together; or if some swerve while others travel in a straight line, but their own natural
tendency, in the first place this will be tantamount to assigning to the atoms their
different spheres of action, some to travel straight and some sideways; while secondly
(and this is a weak point with Democritus also) this riotous hurly-burly of atoms could
not possibly result in the ordered beauty of the world we know. It is also unworthy of a
natural philosopher to deny the infinite divisibility of matter; an error that assuredly
Epicurus would have avoided, if he had been willing to let his friend Polyænus teach him
geometry instead of making Polyænus himself unlearn it. Democritus, being an educated man
and well versed in geometry, thinks the sun is of vast size; Epicurus considers it perhaps
a foot in diameter, for he pronounces it to be exactly as large as it appears, or a little
larger or smaller. Thus where Epicurus alters the doctrines of Democritus, he alters them
for the worse; while for those ideas which he adopts, the credit belongs entirely to
Democritus&#151;the atoms, the void, the images <a HREF="De_Finibus.html#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, or as
they call them, <i>eidola</i>, whose impact is the cause not only of vision but also of
thought; the very conception of infinite space, <i>apeiria </i>as they term it, is
entirely derived from Democritus; and again the countless numbers of worlds that come into
existence and pass out of existence every day. For my own part I reject these doctrines
altogether; but still I could wish that Democritus, whom every one else applauds, had not
been vilified by Epicurus who took him as his sole guide. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="VII"></a><b>VII.</b> &quot;Turn next to the second division of philosophy, the
department of Method and of Dialectic, which its termed <i>Logik<font face="Times New Roman">&#275;</font></i>. Of the whole armor of
Logic your founder, as it seems to me, is absolutely destitute. He does away with
Definition; he has no doctrine of Division or Partition <a HREF="De_Finibus.html#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>;
he gives no rules for Deduction or Syllogistic Inference, and imparts no method for
resolving Dilemmas or for detecting Fallacies of Equivocation. The Criteria of reality he
places in sensation; once let the senses accept as true something that is false, and every
possible criterion of truth and falsehood seems to him to be immediately destroyed...<a
HREF="De_Finibus.html#4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>... He lays the very greatest stress upon that which, as
he declares, Nature herself decrees and sanctions, that is: the feelings of pleasure and
pain. These he maintains lie at the root of every act of choice and of avoidance. This is
the doctrine of Aristippus, and it is upheld more cogently and more frankly by the
Cyrenaics; but nevertheless it is in my judgment a doctrine in the last degree unworthy of
the dignity of man. Nature, in my opinion at all events, has created and endowed us for
higher ends. I may possibly be mistaken; but I am absolutely convinced that the Torquatus
who first won that surname did not wrest the famous necklet from his foe in the hope of
getting from it any physical enjoyment, nor did he fight the battle of the Veseris against
the Latins in his third consulship for the sake of pleasure. Indeed in sentencing his son
to be beheaded, it would seem that he actually deprived himself of a great deal of
pleasure; for he sacrificed his natural instincts of paternal affection to the claims
state and of his military office. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Then, think of the Titus Torquatus who was consul with Gnaeus
Octavius; when he
dealt so sternly with the son who had passed out of his paternal control through his
adoption by Decius Silanus&#151;when he summoned him into his presence to answer to the
charge preferred against him by a deputation from Macedonia, of accepting bribes while
praetor in that province&#151;when, after hearing both sides of the case, he gave judgment
that he found his son guilty of having conducted himself in office in a manner unworthy of
his ancestry, and banished him for ever from his sight&#151;do you think that he had any
regard for his own pleasure? But I pass over the dangers, the toils, the actual pain that
all good men endure for country and for friends, not only not seeking pleasure, but
actually renouncing pleasures altogether, and preferring to undergo every sort of pain
rather than be false to any portion of their duty. Let us turn to matters seemingly less
important, but equally conclusive. What actual pleasure do you, Torquatus, or does
Triarius here, derive from literature, from history and learning, from turning the pages
of the poets and committing vast quantities of verse to memory? Do not tell me that these
pursuits are in themselves a pleasure to you, and that so were the deeds I mentioned to
the Torquati. That line of defense was never taken by Epicurus or Metrodorus, nor by any
one of them if he possessed any intelligence or had mastered the doctrines of your school.
Again, as to the questions often asked, why so many men are Epicureans, though it is not
the only reason, the thing that most attracts the crowd is the belief that Epicurus
declares right conduct and moral worth to be intrinsically and of themselves delightful,
which means productive of pleasure. These worthy people do not realize that, if this is
true, it upsets the theory altogether. If it were admitted that goodness is spontaneously
and intrinsically pleasant, even without any reference to bodily feeling, then virtue
would be desirable for its own sake, and so also would knowledge; but this Epicurus by no
means allows. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;These then,&quot; said I, &quot;are the doctrines of Epicurus that I cannot
accept. For the rest, I could desire that he himself had been better equipped with
learning (since even you must recognize that he is deficient in the liberal culture which
confers on its possessor the title of an educated man) or at all events that he had not
deterred others from study. Although I am aware that he has not succeeded in deterring
you.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="VIII"></a><b>VIII.</b> I had spoken rather with the intention of drawing out
Torquatus than of delivering a discourse of my own. But Triarius interposed, with a smile:
&quot;Why, you have practically expelled Epicurus altogether from the philosophic choir.
What have you left to him except that, whatever his style may be, you find his meaning
intelligible? His doctrines in Natural Philosophy were second-hand, and in your opinion
unsound at that; and his attempts to improve on his authority only made things worse.
Dialectic he had none. His identification of the Chief Good with pleasure in the first
place was in itself an error, and secondly this also was not original; for it had been
said before, and said better, by Aristippus. To crown all you added that Epicurus was a
person of no education.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Well, Triarius,&quot; I rejoined, &quot;when one disagrees with a man, it is
essential to say what it is that one objects to in his views. What should prevent me from
being an Epicurean, if I accepted the doctrines of Epicurus? especially as the system is
an exceedingly easy one to master. You must not find fault with members of opposing
schools for criticizing each other&#146;s opinions; though I always feel that insult and
abuse, or ill-tempered wrangling and bitter, obstinate controversy are beneath the dignity
of philosophy.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;I am quite of you mind,&quot; said Torquatus; &quot;it is impossible to debate
properly without criticizing, but it is equally impossible to debate with ill-temper or
obstinacy. But I have something I should like to say in reply to all this, if it will not
weary you.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Do you suppose,&quot; said I, &quot;that I should have said what I have, unless I
wanted to hear you?&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Then would you like me to make a rapid review of the whole of Epicurus&#146;
system, or to discuss the single topic of pleasure, which is the one main subject of
dispute?&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Oh,&quot; I said, &quot;that must be for you to decide.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Very well then,&quot; said he, &quot;this is what I will do, I will expound a
single topic, and that the most important. Natural Philosophy we will postpone; though I
will undertake to prove to you both your swerve of the atoms and size of the sun, and also
that very many errors of Democritus were criticized and corrected by Epicurus. But on the
present occasion I will speak about pleasure; not that I have anything original to
contribute, yet I am confident that what I say will command even your acceptance.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Be assured,&quot; I said, &quot;that I shall not be obstinate, but will gladly
own myself convinced if you can prove your case to my satisfaction.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;I shall do so,&quot; he rejoined, &quot;provided you are as fair-minded as you
promise. But I prefer to employ continuous discourse rather than question and
answer.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;As you please,&quot; said I. </p>

<p align="justify">So he began. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="IX"></a><b>IX.</b> &quot;I will start then,&quot; he said, &quot;in the manner
approved by the author of the system himself, by settling what are the essence and
qualities of the thing that is the object of our inquiry; not that I suppose you to be
ignorant of it, but because this is the logical method of procedure. We are inquiring,
then, what is the final and ultimate Good, which as all philosophers are agreed must be of
such a nature as to be the End to which all other things are means, while it is not itself
a means to anything else. This Epicurus finds in pleasure; pleasure he holds to be that
Chief Good, pain the Chief Evil. This he sets out to prove as follows: Every animal, as
soon as it is born, seeks for pleasure, and delights in it as the Chief Good, while it
recoils from pain as the Chief Evil, and so far as possible avoids it. This it does as
long as it remains unperverted, at the prompting of Nature&#146;s own unbiased and honest
verdict. Hence Epicurus refuses to admit any necessity for argument or discussion to <i>prove</i>
that pleasure is desirable and pain to be avoided. These facts, he thinks, are perceived
by the senses, as that fire is hot, snow white, honey sweet, none of which things need be
proved by elaborate argument: it is enough merely to draw attention to them. (For there is
a difference, he holds, between formal syllogistic proof of a thing and a mere notice or
reminder: the former is the method for discovering abstruse and recondite truths, the
latter for indicating facts that are obvious and evident.) Strip mankind of sensation, and
nothing remains; it follows that Nature herself is the judge of that which is in
accordance with or contrary to nature. What does Nature perceive or what does she judge
of, beside pleasure and pain, to guide her actions of desire and of avoidance? Some
members of our school however would refine upon this doctrine; these say that it is not
enough for the judgment of good and evil to rest with the senses; the facts that pleasure
is in and for itself desirable and pain in and for itself to be avoided can also be
grasped by the intellect and reason. Accordingly they declare that the perception in which
the one is to be sought after and the other avoided is a notion naturally implanted in our
minds. Others again, with whom I agree, observing that a great many philosophers do
advance a vast array of reasons to prove why pleasure should not be counted as a good nor
pain as an evil, consider that we had better not be too confident of our case; in their
view it requires elaborate and reasoned argument, and abstruse theoretical discussion of
the nature of pleasure and pain. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="X"></a><b>X. </b>&quot;But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose. To do so, I will give you a complete
account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure
itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone
who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault
with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with
righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
the pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our
power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain emergencies
and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur
that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;This being the theory I hold, why need I be afraid of not being able to reconcile
it with the case of the Torquati my ancestors? Your references to them just now were
historically correct, and also showed your kind and friendly feeling towards myself; but
all the same I am not to be bribed by your flattery of my family, and you will not find me
a less resolute opponent. Tell me, please, what explanation do you put upon their actions?
Do you really believe that they charged an armed enemy, or treated their children, their
own flesh and blood, so cruelly, without a thought for their own interest or advantage?
Why, even wild animals do not act in that way; they do not run amok so blindly that we
cannot discern any purpose in their movements and their onslaughts. Can you then suppose
that those heroic men performed their famous deeds without any motive at all? What their
motive was, I will consider later on: for the present I will confidently assert, that if
they had a motive for those undoubtedly glorious exploits, that motive was not a love of
virtue in and for itself. He wrested the necklet from his foe&#151;yes, and saved himself
from death. But he braved great danger&#151;yes, before the eyes of an army. What did he
get from it?&#151;honor and esteem, the strongest guarantees of security in life. He
sentenced his own son to death&#151;if from no motive, then I am sorry to be the
descendant of anyone so savage and inhuman; but if his purpose was, by inflicting pain
upon himself, to establish his authority as a commander and to tighten the reins of
discipline during a very serious war by holding over his army the fear of punishment, then
his action aimed at ensuring the safety of his fellow citizens, upon which he knew his own
depended. And this is a principle of wide application. People of your school, and
especially yourself, who are so diligent a student of history, have found a favorite field
for the display of your eloquence in recalling the stories of brave and famous men of old,
and in praising their actions, not on utilitarian grounds, but on account of the splendor
of abstract moral worth. But all of this falls to the ground if the principle of selection
that I have just mentioned be established&#151;the principle of forgoing pleasures for the
purpose of getting greater pleasures, and enduring pains for the sake of escaping greater
pains. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XI"></a><b>XI.</b> &quot;But enough has been said at this stage about the
glorious exploits and achievements of the heroes of renown. The tendency of all of the
virtues to produce pleasure is a topic that will be treated in its own place later on. At
present I shall proceed to expound the essence and qualities of pleasure itself, and shall
endeavor to remove the misconceptions of ignorance and to make you realize how serious,
how temperate, how austere is the school that is supposed to be sensual, lax, and
luxurious. The pleasure we pursue is not that kind alone which directly affects our
physical being with a delightful feeling&#151;a positively agreeable perception of the
senses; on the contrary, the greatest pleasure according to us is that which is
experienced as a result of the complete removal of pain. When we are released from pain,
the mere sensation of complete emancipation and relief from uneasiness is in itself a
source of gratification. But everything that causes gratification is a pleasure (just as
everything that causes annoyance is a pain). Therefore the complete removal of pain has
correctly been termed a pleasure. For example, when hunger and thirst are banished by food
and drink, the mere fact of getting rid of uneasiness brings a resultant pleasure in its
train. So generally, the removal of pain causes pleasure to take its place. Epicurus
consequently maintained that there is no such thing as a neutral state of feeling
intermediate between pleasure and pain; for the state supposed by some thinkers to be
neutral, being characterized as it is by entire absence of pain, is itself, he held, a
pleasure, and, what is more, a pleasure of the highest order. A man who is conscious of
his condition at all must necessarily feel either pleasure or pain. But complete absence
of pain Epicurus considers to be the limit and highest point of pleasure; beyond this
point pleasure may vary in kind, but it cannot vary in intensity or degree. Yet at Athens,
so my father used to tell me when he wanted to air his wit at the expense of the Stoics,
in the Ceramicus there is actually a statue of Chrysippus seated and holding out one hand,
the gesture being intended to indicate the delight which he used to take in the following
little syllogism: &#145;Does your hand want anything, while it is in its present
condition?&#146; Answer: &#145;No, nothing.&#146;&#151;&#145;But if pleasure were a good,
it would want pleasure.&#146;&#151;&#145;Yes, I suppose it
would.&#146;&#151;&#145;Therefore pleasure is not a good.&#146; An argument, as my father
declared, which not even a statue would employ, if a statue could speak; because though it
is appropriate as an objection to the Cyrenaics, it does not touch Epicurus. For if the
only kind of pleasure were that which so to speak tickles the senses, an influence
permeating them with a feeling of delight, neither the hand nor any other member could be
satisfied with the absence of pain unaccompanied by an agreeable and active sensation of
pleasure. Whereas if, as Epicurus holds, the highest pleasure be to feel no pain,
Chrysippus&#146; interlocutor, though justified in making his first admission, that his
hand in that condition wanted nothing, was not justified in his second admission, that if
pleasure were a good, his hand would have wanted it. And the reason why it would not have
wanted pleasure is, that to be without pain is to be in a state of pleasure. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XII"></a><b>XII. </b>&quot;The truth of the proposition that pleasure is the
ultimate good will most readily appear from the following illustration. Let us imagine a
man living in the continuous enjoyment of numerous and vivid pleasures alike of body and
of mind, undisturbed either by the presence or by the prospect of pain: what possible
state of existence could we describe as being more excellent or more desirable? One so
situated must possess in the first place a strength of mind that is proof against all fear
of death or of pain; he will know that death means complete unconsciousness, and that pain
is generally light if long and short if strong, so that its intensity is compensated by
brief duration and its continuance by diminishing severity. Let such a man moreover have
no dread of any supernatural power; let him never suffer the pleasures of the past to fade
away, but constantly renew their enjoyment in recollection&#151;and his lot will be one
which will not admit of further improvement. Suppose on the other hand a person crushed
beneath the heaviest load of mental and of bodily anguish to which humanity is liable.
Grant him no hope of ultimate relief in view; also give him no pleasure either present or
in prospect. Can one describe or imagine a more pitiable state? If then, a life full of
pain is the thing most to be avoided, it follows that to live in pain is the highest evil;
and this position implies that a life of pleasure ultimate good. In fact the mind
possesses nothing in itself upon which it can rest as final. Every fear, every sorrow can
be traced back to pain; there is not other thing besides pain which is of its own nature
capable of causing either anxiety or distress. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;Pleasure and pain moreover supply the motives of desire and of avoidance, and the
springs of conduct generally. This being so, it clearly follows that actions are right and
praiseworthy only as being a means to the attainment of a life of pleasure. But that which
is not itself a means to anything else, but to which all else is a means, is what the
Greeks term the <i>telos</i>, the highest, ultimate or final Good. It must therefore be
admitted that the Chief Good is to live happily. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XIII"></a><b>XIII.</b> &quot;Those who place the Chief Good in virtue alone
are beguiled by the glamour of a name, and do not understand the true demands of nature.
If they will consent to listen to Epicurus, they will be delivered from the grossest
error. Your school dilates on the transcendent beauty of the virtues; but were they not
productive of pleasure, who would deem them either praiseworthy or desirable? We esteem
the art of medicine not for its interest as a science but for its conduciveness to health;
the art of navigation is commended for its practical and not its scientific value, because
it conveys the rules for sailing a ship with success. So also Wisdom, which must be
considered as the art of living, if it effected no result would not be desired; but as it
is, it is desired, because it is the artificer that procures and produces pleasure. (The
meaning that I attach to pleasure must by this time be clear to you, and you must not be
biased against my argument owing to the discreditable associations of the term.) The great
disturbing factor in man&#146;s life is ignorance of good and evil; mistaken ideas about
these frequently rob us of our greatest pleasures, and torment us with the most cruel pain
of mind. Hence we need the aid of Wisdom, to rid us of our fears and appetites, to root
out all our errors and prejudices, and to serve as our infallible guide to the attainment
of pleasure. Wisdom alone can banish sorrow from our hearts and protect us from alarm and
apprehension; put yourself to school with her, and you may live in peace, and quench the
glowing flames of desire. For the desires are incapable of satisfaction; they ruin not
individuals only but whole families, nay often shake the very foundations of the state. It
is they that are the source of hatred, quarreling and strife, of sedition and of war. Nor
do they only flaunt themselves abroad, or turn their blind onslaughts solely against
other; even when imprisoned within the heart they quarrel and fall out among themselves;
and this cannot but render the whole of life embittered. Hence only the Wise Man, who
prunes away all the rank growth of vanity and error, can possibly live untroubled by
sorrow and by fear, content within the bounds that nature has set. Nothing could be more
useful or more conducive to well-being than Epicurus&#146; doctrine as to the different
classes of the desires. One kind he classified as both natural and necessary, a second as
natural without being necessary, and a third as neither natural nor necessary; the
principle of classification being that the necessary desires are gratified with little
trouble or expense; the natural desires also require by little, since nature&#146;s own
riches, which suffice to content her, are both easily procured and limited in amount; but
for the imaginary desires no bound or limit can be discovered. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XIV"></a><b>XIV.</b> If then we observe that ignorance and error reduce the
whole of life to confusion, while Wisdom alone is able to protect us from the onslaughts
of appetite and the menaces of fear, teaching us to bear even the affronts of fortune with
moderation, and showing us all the paths that lead to calmness and to peace, why should we
hesitate to avow that Wisdom is to be desired for the sake of the pleasures it brings and
Folly to be avoided because of its injurious consequences? </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;The same principle will lead us to pronounce that Temperance also is not
desirable for its own sake, but because it bestows peace of mind, and soothes the hear
with a tranquilizing sense of harmony For it is Temperance that warns us to be guided by
reason what we desire and avoid. Nor is it enough to judge what it is right to do or to
leave undone; we also need to abide by our judgment. Most men however lack tenacity of
purpose; their resolution weakens and succumbs as soon as the fair form of pleasures meets
their gaze, and they surrender themselves prisoners to their passions, failing to foresee
the inevitable result. Thus for the sake of pleasure at once small in amount and
unnecessary, and one which they might have procured by other means or even denied
themselves altogether without pain, they incur serious disease, or loss of fortune, or
disgrace, and not infrequently become liable to the penalties of the law and of the courts
of justice. Those on the other hand who are resolved so to enjoy their pleasures as to
avoid all painful consequences therefrom, and who retain their faculty of judgment and
avoid being seduced by pleasure into course that they perceive to be wrong, reap the very
highest pleasure by forgoing pleasure. Similarly also they often voluntarily endure pain,
to avoid incurring greater pain by not doing so. This clearly proves that Intemperance is
not undesirable for its own sake, while Temperance is desirable not because it renounces
pleasures, but because it procures greater pleasures. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XV"></a><b>XV. </b>&quot;The same account will be found to hold good of
Courage. The performance of labors, the undergoing of pains, are not in themselves
attractive, nor are endurance, industry, watchfulness, nor yet that much lauded virtue,
perseverance, nor even courage; but we aim at these virtues in order to live without
anxiety and fear and so far as possible to be free from pain of mind and body. The fear of
death plays havoc with the calm and even tenor of life, and to bow the head to pain and
bear it abjectly and feebly is a pitiable thing; such weakness has caused many men to
betray their parents other friends, some their country, and very many utterly to ruin
themselves. So on the other hand a strong and lofty spirit is entirely free from anxiety
and sorrow. It makes light of pain, and slight ones have frequent intervals of respite;
while those of medium intensity lie within our own control: we can bear them if they are
endurable, or if they are not, we may serenely quit life&#146;s theater, when the play has
ceased to please us. These considerations prove that timidity and cowardice are not
blamed, nor courage and endurance praised, on their own account; the former are rejected
because they beget pain, the latter coveted because they beget pleasure. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XVI"></a><b>XVI. </b>&quot;It remains to speak of Justice, to complete the
list of the virtues; but this admits of practically the same treatment as the others.
Wisdom, Temperance and Courage I have shown to be so closely linked with Pleasures that
they cannot possibly be severed or sundered from it. The same must be deemed to be the
case with Justice. Not only does Justice never causes anyone harm, but on the contrary it
always adds some benefit, partly owning to its essentially tranquilizing influence upon
the mind, partly because of the hope that it warrants of a never-failing supply of the
things that uncorrupted nature really needs. And just as Rashness, License and Cowardice
ever torment the mind, ever awaken trouble and discord, so Unrighteousness, when firmly
rooted in the heart, causes restlessness by the mere fact of its presence; and if once it
has found expression in some deed of wickedness, however secret the act, yet it can never
feel assured that it will always remain undetected. The usual consequences of crime are,
first suspicion, next gossip and rumor, then comes the accuser, then the judge; many
wrongdoers have even turned in evidence against themselves, as happened during your
consulship. And even if any think themselves well fenced and fortified against detection
by their fellow-men, they still dread the eye of heaven, and fancy that the pangs of
anxiety night and day gnawing at their hearts are sent by Providence to punish them. But
what can wickedness contribute towards lessening the annoyances of life, commensurate with
its effect in increasing them, owing to the burden of a guilty conscience, the penalties
of the law and the hatred of one&#146;s fellows? Yet nevertheless some men indulge without
limit their avarice, ambition and love of power, lust gluttony and those other desires,
which ill-gotten gains can never diminish but rather must inflame the more, insomuch that
they appear proper subjects for restraint rather than for reformation. Men of sound
natures, therefore, are summoned by the voice of true reason to justice, equity and
honesty. For one without eloquence or resources, dishonesty is not good policy, since it
is difficult for such a man to succeed in his designs, or to make good his success when
once achieved. On the other hand, for the rich and clever generous conduct seems more in
keeping, and liberality wins them affection and good will, the surest means to a life of
peace; especially as there really is no motive for transgressing: since the desires that
spring from nature are easily gratified without doing any man wrong, while those that are
imaginary ought to be resisted, for they set their affections upon nothing that is really
wanted; while there is more loss inherent in Injustice itself than there is profit in the
gains it brings. Hence Justice also cannot correctly be said to be desirable in and for
itself; it is so because it is so highly productive of gratification. For esteem and
affection are gratifying, because they render life safer and fuller of pleasure. Hence we
hold that Unrighteousness is to be avoided not simply on account of the disadvantages that
result from being unrighteous, but even far more because when it dwells in a man&#146;s
heart it never suffers him to breath freely or know a moment&#146;s rest. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;If then even the glory of the Virtues, on which all the other philosophers love
to expatiate so eloquently, has in the last resort no meaning unless it be based on
pleasure, whereas pleasure is the only thing that is intrinsically attractive and
alluring, it cannot be doubted that pleasure is the one supreme and final Good and that a
life of happiness is nothing else then a life of pleasure. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XVII"></a><b>XVII.</b> <a HREF="De_Finibus.html#5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The doctrine thus
firmly established has corollaries which I will briefly expound. </p>

<p align="justify">(1) The Ends of Goods and Evils themselves, that is pleasure and pain, are not open to
mistake; where people go wrong is not knowing what things are productive of pleasure and
pain. (2) Again, we assert that mental pleasures and pains arise out of bodily ones (and
therefore I allow your contention that any Epicureans who think otherwise put themselves
out of court; and I am aware that many do, though not those who can speak with authority);
but although men do experience mental pain that is annoying, yet both of these we assert
arise out of and are based upon bodily sensations. (3) Yet we maintain that this does not
preclude mental pleasures and pains from being much more intense than those of the body;
since the body can feel only what is present to it at the moment, whereas the mind is also
cognizant of the past and of the future. For granting that pain of body is equally
painful, yet our sensation of pain can be enormously increased by the belief that some
evil of unlimited magnitude and duration threatens to befall us hereafter. And the same
consideration may be transferred to pleasure: a pleasure is greater if not accompanied by
any apprehension of evil. It therefore clearly appears that intense mental pleasure or
distress contributes more to our happiness or misery than a bodily pleasure or pain of
equal duration. (4) But we do not agree that when an active sensation of pleasure is
withdrawn uneasiness at once ensues, unless the pleasure happens to have been replaced by
a pain: while on the other hand one is glad to lose a pain even though no active sensation
of pleasure comes in its place: a fact that serves to show how great a pleasure is the
mere absence of pain. (5) But just as we are elated by the anticipation of good things, so
we are delighted by their recollection. Fools are tormented by the memory of former evils;
wise men have the delight of renewing in grateful remembrance the blessings of the past.
We have the power both to obliterate our misfortunes in an almost perpetual forgetfulness
and to summon up pleasant and agreeable memories of our successes. But when we fix our
mental vision closely on the events of the past, then sorrow or gladness ensues according
as these were evil or good. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XVIII"></a><b>XVIII.</b> &quot;Here is indeed a royal road to
happiness&#151;open, simple, and direct! For clearly man can have no greater good than
complete freedom from pain and sorrow coupled with the enjoyment of the highest bodily and
mental pleasures. Notice then how the theory embraces every possible enhancement of life,
every aid to the attainment of that Chief Good which is our object. Epicurus, the man whom
you denounce as a voluptuary, cries aloud that no one can live pleasantly without living
wisely, honorably, and justly, and no one wisely, honorably and justly without living
pleasurably. For a city rent by faction cannot prosper, nor a house whose masters are at
strife; much less then can a mind divided against itself and filled with inward discord
taste any particle of pure and liberal pleasure. But one who is perpetually swayed by
conflicting and incompatible counsels and desires can know no peace or calm. Why, if the
pleasantness of life is diminished by the more serious bodily diseases, how much more must
it be diminished by the diseases of the mind! But extravagant and imaginary desires, for
riches, fame, power, and also for licentious pleasures, are nothing but mental diseases.
Then, too, there are grief, trouble and sorrow, which gnaw the heart and consume it with
anxiety, if men fail to realize that the mind need feel no pain unconnected with some pain
of body, present or to come. Yet there is no foolish man but is afflicted by some one of
these diseases; therefore there is no foolish man that is not unhappy. Moreover, there is
death, the stone of Tantalus ever hanging over men&#146;s heads; and superstition, that
poisons and destroys all peace of mind. Besides, they do not recollect their past nor
enjoy their present blessings; they merely look forward to those of the future, and as
these are of necessity uncertain, they are consumed with agony and terror; and the climax
of their torment is when they perceive too late that all their dreams of wealth or
station, power or fame, have come to nothing. For they never attain any of the pleasures,
the hope of which inspired them to undergo all their arduous toils. Or look again at
others, petty, narrow-minded men, or confirmed pessimists, or spiteful, envious,
ill-tempered creatures, unsociable, abusive, brutal; others again enslaved to the follies
of love, impudent or reckless, wanton, headstrong and yet irresolute, always changing
their minds. Such failings render their lives one unbroken round of misery. The conclusion
is that no foolish man can be happy, nor any wise man fail to be happy. This is a truth
that we establish far more conclusively than do the Stoics. For they maintain that nothing
is good save that vague phantom which they entitle Moral Worth, a title more splendid than
substantial; and say that Virtue resting on this Moral Worth has no need of pleasure, but
is herself her own sufficient happiness. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XIX"></a><b>XIX. </b>&quot;At the same time this Stoic doctrine can be stated
in a form which we do not object to, and indeed ourselves endorse. For Epicurus thus
presents his Wise Man who is always happy: his desires are kept within bounds; death he
disregards; he has a true conception, untainted by fear, of the Divine nature; he does not
hesitate to depart from life, if that would better his condition. Thus equipped he enjoys
perpetual pleasure, for there is no moment when the pleasures he experiences do not
outbalance the pains; since he remembers the past with gratitude, grasps the present with
a full realization of its pleasantness, and does not rely upon the future; he looks
forward to it, but finds his true enjoyment in the present. Also he is entirely free from
the vices that I instanced a few moment ago, and he derives no inconsiderable pleasure
from comparing his own existence with the life of the foolish. Moreover, any pains that
the Wise Man may encounter are never so severe but that he has more cause for gladness
than for sorrow. Again, it is a fine saying of Epicurus that &#145;the Wise Man is but
little interfered with by Fortune: the great concerns of life, the things that matter, are
controlled by his own Wisdom and Reason;' and that &#145;no greater pleasure could be
derived from a life of infinite duration than is actually afforded by this existence which
we know to be finite.&#146; Logic, on which your school lays such stress, he held to be of
no effect either as a guide to conduct or as an aid to thought. Natural Philosophy he
deemed all-important. This science <a HREF="De_Finibus.html#6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> explains to us the
meaning of terms, the nature of predication, and the law of consistency and contradiction;
secondly, a thorough knowledge of the facts of nature relieves us of the burden of
superstition, frees us from fear of death, and shields us against the disturbing effects
of ignorance, which is often in itself a cause of terrifying apprehensions; lastly, to
learn what nature&#146;s real requirements are improves the moral character also. Besides,
it is only by firmly grasping a well-established scientific system, observing the Rule or
Canon that has fallen as it were from heaven so that all men may know it&#151;only by
making that Canon the test of all our judgments, that we can hope always to stand fast in
our belief unshaken by the eloquence of any man. On the other hand, without a full
understanding of the world of nature it is impossible to maintain the truth of our
sense-perceptions. Further, every mental presentations has its origin in sensation: so
that no certain knowledge will be possible, unless all sensations are true, as the theory
of Epicurus teaches that they are. Those who deny the validity of sensation and say that
nothing can be perceived, having excluded the evidence of the senses, are unable even to
expound their own argument. Besides, by abolishing knowledge and science they abolish all
possibility of rational life and action. Thus Natural Philosophy supplies courage to face
the fear of death; resolution to resist the terrors of religion; peace of mind, for it
removes all ignorance of the mysteries of nature; self-control, for it explains the nature
of the desires and distinguishes their different kinds; and, as I showed just now, the
Canon or Criterion of Knowledge, which Epicurus also established, gives a method of
discerning truth from falsehood. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XX"></a><b>XX.</b> &quot;There remains a topic that is pre-eminently germane
to this discussion, I mean the subject of Friendship. Your school maintains that if
pleasure be the Chief Good, friendship will cease to exist. Now Epicurus&#146;
pronouncement about friendship is that of all the means to happiness that wisdom has
devised, none is greater, none more fruitful, none more delightful than this. Nor did he
only commend this doctrine by his eloquence, but far more by the example of his life and
conduct. How great a thing friendship is, is shown by the mythical stories of antiquity.
Review the legends from the remotest ages, and, copious and varied as they are, you will
barely find in them three pairs of friends, beginning with Theseus and ending with
Orestes. Yet Epicurus in single house and that a small one maintained a whole company of
friends, united by the closest sympathy and affection; and this still goes on in the
Epicurean school. But to return to our subject, for there is no need of personal
instances: <a NAME="66"></a>I notice that the topic of friendship has been treated by
Epicureans in three ways. (1) Some have denied that pleasures affecting our friends are in
themselves to be desired by us in the same degree as we desire our own pleasures. This
doctrine is thought by some critics to undermine the foundations of friendship; however,
its supporters defend their position and in my opinion have no difficulty in making good
their ground. They argue that friendship can no more be sundered form pleasure than can
the virtues, which we have discussed already. A solitary, friendless life must be beset by
secret dangers and alarms. Hence reason itself advises the acquisition of friends; their
possession gives confidence, and a firmly rooted hope of winning pleasure. And just as
hatred, jealousy and contempt are hindrances to pleasure, so friendship is the most
trustworthy preserver and also creator of pleasure alike for our friends and for
ourselves. It affords us enjoyment in the present, and it inspires us with hope for the
near and distant future. Thus it is not possible to secure uninterrupted gratification in
life without friendship is the most trustworthy preserver and also creator of pleasure
alike for our friends and for ourselves. It affords us enjoyment in the present, and it
inspires us with hopes for the near and distant future. Thus it is not possible to secure
uninterrupted gratification in life without friendship, nor yet to preserve friendship
itself unless we love our friends as much as ourselves. Hence this unselfishness does
occur in friendship, while also friendship is closely link with pleasure. For we rejoice
in our friends&#146; joy as much as in our own, and are equally painted by their sorrows.
Therefore the Wise Man will feel exactly the same towards his friend as he does towards
himself, and will exert himself as much for his friend&#146;s pleasure as he would for his
own. All that has been said about the essential connection of the virtues with pleasure
must be repeated about friendship. Epicurus said well (I give almost his exact words):
&#145;The same creed that has given us courage to overcome all fear of everlasting or
long-enduring evil hereafter, has discerned that friendship is our strongest safeguard in
this present term of life.&#146;&#151;(2) Other Epicureans though by no means lacking in
insight are a little less courageous in defying the opprobrious criticism of the Academy.
They fear that if we hold friendship to be desirable only for the pleasure that it affords
to ourselves, it will be thought that it is crippled altogether. They therefore say that
the first advances and overtures, and the original inclination to form an attachment, are
promoted by the desire for pleasure, but that when the progress of intercourse has led to
intimacy, the relationship blossoms into an affection strong enough to make us love our
friends for their own sake, even though no practical advantage accrues from their
friendship. Does not familiarity endear to us localities, temples, cities, gymnasia and
playgrounds, horses and hounds, gladiatorial shows and fight with wild beasts? Then how
much more natural and reasonable that this should be able to happen in our intercourse
with our fellow-men!--(3) The third view is that wise men have made a sort of compact to
love their friends no less than themselves. We can understand the possibility of this, and
we often see it happen. Clearly no more effective means to happiness could be found than
such an alliance. </p>

<p align="justify">&quot;All these considerations go to prove not only that the theory of friendship is
not embarrassed by the identification of the Chief Good with pleasure, but also that
without this no foundation for friendship whatsoever can be found. </p>

<p align="justify"><a NAME="XXI"></a><b>XXI. </b>&quot;If then the doctrine I have set forth is clearer
and more luminous than daylight itself; if it is derived entirely from Nature&#146;s
source; if my whole discourse relies throughout for confirmation on the unbiased and
unimpeachable evidence of the senses; if lisping infants, nay even dumb animals prompted
by Nature&#146;s teaching, almost find voice to proclaim that there is no welfare but
pleasure, no hardship but pain&#151;and their judgment in these matters is neither
sophisticated nor biased&#151;ought we not to feel the greatest gratitude to him who
caught this utterance of Nature&#146;s voice, and grasped its import so firmly and so
fully that he has guided all sane-minded men into the paths of peace and happiness,
calmness and repose? You are disposed to think him uneducated. The reason is that he
refused to consider any education worth the name that did not help to school us in
happiness. Was he to spend his time, as you encourage Triarius and me to do, in perusing
poets, who give us nothing solid and useful, but merely childish amusement? Was he to
occupy himself like Plato with music and geometry, arithmetic and astrology, which
starting from false premises cannot be true, and which moreover if they were true would
contribute nothing to make our lives pleasanter and therefore better? Was he, I say, to
study arts like these, and neglect the master art, so difficult and correspond so
fruitful, the art of living? No! Epicurus was not uneducated: the real philistines are
those who ask us to go on studying till old age the subjects that we ought to be ashamed
not to have learnt in boyhood.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">Thus concluding, he added: &quot;I have explained my own view, but solely with the
object of learning what your verdict is. I have never hitherto had a satisfactory
opportunity of hearing it.&quot; </p>

from sensation, which are a crude adumbration of a Logic of Induction. </p>
