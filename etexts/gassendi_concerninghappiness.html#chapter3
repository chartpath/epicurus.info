        What happiness is</font></p>
      
        </b>
        <p ALIGN="justify">
        <img border="0" src="gassendi.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" alt="Pierre Gassendi" width="229" height="253" hspace="0">Although happiness is properly the same thing as the
        enjoyment of the chief good, and therefore the best experience which may
        be desired, nevertheless because this state of enjoyment includes the
        chief good, happiness itself was made to be called the chief good. It is
        called the “chief of goods,” “the ultimate good,” “the end of
        the ends,” and “the end <i>par excellence</i>,” because all other
        things are desired and sought after for its sake, while happiness itself is
        ultimately desired for its own sake. Aristotle teaches us that “among
        desirable things, it is necessary that there be an ultimate good, rather
        than going on<i> ad infinitum.</i>” But let’s first consider two
        important points.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">The first is, that we shall not concern ourselves
        here with the happiness upheld by Holy Men, particularly when they teach
        how happy is he who is helped by Divine Providence, devotes himself
        purely to the worship of God, and who, full of faith, hope, and charity,
        spends the rest of his days gently and calmly. We will speak only about
        that which can be known as <i>natural</i>, i.e., acquirable by natural
        means, which the philosophers did not ever doubt could be obtained on
        Earth.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">The second point is that this natural happiness is
        such that one cannot conceive of circumstances which are imaginably
        better, sweeter, or more desirable. In such a condition there is no evil
        to fear, no lack of good things, nothing one cares to do that is beyond
        one’s power, and one is completely stable, safe, and secure. But we
        understand that although this sort of condition is possible in which
        there are necessary goods in abundance, very little that is evil, and in
        which one can thereby live as gently, calmly, and securely as the
        conditions of our country, society, lifestyle, health, age, and other
        such circumstances allow, it remains that to promise oneself, or to
        realize this supreme happiness during the course of our life, it is to
        not recognize, or to have forgotten, that one is a man, i.e. a feeble
        and weak animal who by the condition of his nature is vulnerable to an
        infinity of evils, and miseries.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">And it is in this sense which we say that the wise
        man, no matter how tormented by cruel pains, can yet be content in this
        perfect and supreme happiness For this human happiness is always
        experienced in the wise as greatly as possible. The wise man does not
        worsen his misfortunes with impatience and despair; he instead soothes himself by his devotion. He is happier, or to say it better, <i>less
        unhappy</i> than if he succumbed in the manner of those who could not
        maintain themselves in such a plight with the same virtue and the same
        courage, and moreover do not have, as he does, the comfort that wisdom
        provides, such as a guilt-free life and a conscience beyond reproach,
        which is always a marvelous consolation.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">This is why one should not go so far as to say that
        it is thus indifferent to wise man if he is burning in Phalaris’
        brazen bull, or is in sweet repose upon a bed of roses, because he would
        rather not suffer from things like fire and torments – things which he
        would wish to be free of. But when they arrive, he considers them as
        inevitable evils, and he endures them courageously; so that he can say <i>“Vror
        sed invictus; </i>I burn, it is true, and suffer, I sigh and cry, but I
        do not succumb. I am not vanquished and I do not let myself become a
        desperate coward, which would render my condition even more miserable.”</p>

        <p ALIGN="justify"><a name="#1.2"></a>Several opinions concerning the
        main causes of happiness</p>
        </b>
        <p ALIGN="justify">To begin with, the main causes of happiness are
        nothing less than the goods of the mind, body, and fortune. Some
        philosophers highly extol one or the other, and some include them all.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Of those who chiefly recommend the goods of
        the mind, Anaxagoras proposes “the happiness in the contemplation
        things with the kind of freedom which is borne of delightful knowledge.”
        Posidonius, “contemplation with self-mastery over irrational impulses;”
        Herillus, generally and simply “wisdom;” Apollodorus and Lycus,
        generally “pleasures of the mind;” Leucinus, “the pleasures
        recurring from honest things;” the Stoics – Zeno, Cleanthes, Aristus,
        and the others – “virtue,” going so far as to say “that in
        possessing virtue, it doesn’t matter if one is healthy or sick.” All
        the others maintained a consensus that “living happily was nothing
        else than living virtuously,” or, as they expressed it, “according
        to nature.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Of those who prefer the goods of the body,
        and who mainly have only sensual pleasure in mind, these were named “the
        voluptuous,” <i>voluptuarii philosophi</i>, about whom we will be
        obliged to speak when we compare them with Epicurus. It will be enough
        to note here in passing that they had Aristippus for their leader, and
        with him the Cyrenaics, about whom we will also speak further on, and
        the Annicerians who followed the Cyrenaics. They did not recognize any
        specified goal of life, but pursued the particular pleasure of any kind
        of action whatsoever.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Finally, among those who give value to the goods of
        fortune, they are very truly a crude sort of the people, who, with
        extraordinary avarice, look upon riches, others upon honors, still
        others upon other things. But among philosophers, only those who link
        these kinds of external goods to the goods of the mind and of the body
        are worth citing. For these are the ones who inspired the beautiful
        depictions of happiness which poets drew from the various opinions of
        philosophers, such as this, in which virtue requires good fortune:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify"><i>Virtus colenda; Sors petenda a Diis bona:<br>
            Hac quippe duo cui suppetunt, is vivere<br>
            Et vir beatus, &amp; bonus simul potest</i></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Another requires that one has health, a good nature,
        some riches acquired without fraud, and finally to live his life
        congenially among his friends.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify"><i>Fragili viro optima res bene valere<br>

        <p ALIGN="justify">Martial (Marcus Valerius Martialis) demands several
        other things, such as the goods of inheritance, which do not constitute
        a struggle to be acquired, to be free of prosecution, to seldom enter

        accompanied by prudence and friends of equal condition, a woman who is
        not ugly but who nevertheless has modesty, a slumber which makes the
        nights short, a desire to be only what one is, neither to fear nor to

        <p ALIGN="justify">Here we may first observe, as Horace says following
        Aristotle, that many are often mistaken in the pursuit of happiness by
        making it consist of things which they miss and admire in the others,
        e.g., <i>knowledge</i> among the ignorant, <i>wealth</i> among the poor,
        or <i>health </i>among the sick. Horace expresses this well in his
        satires regarding the merchant, the soldier, and the ploughman, each of
        whom admires and envies the fortune of the other.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify">Oh happy seaman! Cries the old son of war,<br>
            With battered limbs, and half his face a scar.<br>
            The restless seaman, when insulting gales<br>
            Toss the light boat, and conquer all his sails<br>
            (If fear allows one distant thought, or word,)<br>
            Trembling applauds the brother of the sword.<br>
            The man of law when pondering at the door,<br>
            His wakeful client knocks him up at four<br>
            Would leave the bar, to lie securely warm,<br>
            And part with all his practice for a farm.<br>
            The clumsy peasant, if when harvest is done,<br>
            A kind subpoena calls him up to town;<br>
            It’s odd, but ravished with the gaudy scene,<br>
            He sells his team, sets up for citizen.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Secondly, to admire nothing, as Horace again says
        following Aristotle, is just about the only thing that can make a man
        happy and maintain his happiness.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify">Not to admire, as most are wont to do,<br>

        <p ALIGN="justify">This not only shows the onset of serenity, but having
        recognized the vanity of human affairs he does not admire, nor loves,
        but rather condemns the glare of power, of honors, and of riches which
        usually dazzle the eyes of men; it moreover shows that this other kind
        of peace was acquired by he who has recognized the natural causes, who
        is not dumbfounded, does not fear, and doesn’t overreact like common
        men do.</p>

        <p ALIGN="justify">Thirdly, that the sweet repose or cherished
        relaxation which one finds in solitude, and away from the discomfiture
        of worldly affairs, contributes much to happiness. Democritus,
        especially, said that he who aspires to the true goodness of life, which
        consists mainly in peace of mind, does not need to encumber himself in
        much business, be it private or public; and it is known that an oracle
        estimated the Great King Gyges to be much unhappier than the old man
        Aglaus Psophidius, who in a corner of Arcadia farmed a small place from
        which he drew life’s necessities in abundance and, having never left
        this small spot of ground, lived gently without ambition and without
        having felt the slightest of evils that torment the majority of mankind.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">It is this sweet repose which Horace also recommended
        in his praise of the rustic lifestyle, having said that he who lives it
        is happy; not being charged with debts, he simply devotes himself in the
        fashion of the earliest men, plowing his native land without knowing
        neither war, nor the sea, nor the bar, nor grand houses.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify">Happy the man, whom bounteous gods allow,<br>
            With his own hands paternal grounds to plough!<br>
            Like the first golden mortal happy he<br>
            From business and the cares of money free!<br>
            No human storms break off at land his sleep,<br>
            No loud alarms of nature on the deep.<br>
            From all the cheats of law, he lives secure,<br>
            Nor do the affronts of palaces endure.</p>

          </blockquote>
        </font>
      
        <p ALIGN="justify">And this is what Virgil also wanted to express to us
        when he exclaims,</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify">Oh exceedingly blessed ploughmen,<br>
            If you only knew how well off you are!<br>
            Happily you live far from the noise of weapons,<br>
            Contently and satisfied with the fruits<br>
            Of which the ground rewards your hard work!<br>
            If your houses do not overflow with crowds of people,<br>
            Who every morning come to say ‘hello…’</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">( … at least nothing prevents you from living a
        guiltless life – a life which is preferable to all the riches of the
        world. For this, you slept calmly and without disturbance in the shade
        of your woods, and for this you enjoyed a steady, firm, and secure peace
        of mind.)</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">As for Epicurus, about whom we will discuss more at length
        later, he formulates happiness to consist in the absence of pain in the
        body and in peace of mind, while maintaining that the effective causes
        of happiness are neither wines, nor delicious meals, nor any other such
        things, but a sound, just, and enlightened rationality, accompanied by
        inseparable virtues, that considers and examines the causes, and the
        motives which compel us to choose or avoid something. Because his
        teachings have happiness in mind, he insists on thinking carefully about
        the things which create happiness. And because the most important thing
        of all is that the mind be released from certain erroneous beliefs that
        generate ceaseless anxieties and unnecessary terrors, he introduces some
        key principles that he believes to be of such importance that, when
        well-examined, they ease the mind and give a real and solid happiness.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <b>
        <p ALIGN="justify"><font size="3"><a name="#1.3"></a>Some principles
        that unfailingly contribute to peace of mind</font></p>
          </b>
        <p ALIGN="justify"><i>The first principle is in regard to the knowledge and
        fear of God</i>.&nbsp; It’s for good reason that this philosopher
        wants us to begin with the ideas by which one must apprehend this
        sovereign being; because he who has a correct notion of him, finds
        himself full of love for him, and conducts himself in such manner as he
        pleases: he devotes himself to honesty and virtue, entrusting himself
        moreover in his infinite goodness, expecting everything of him, as being
        the source of all good, and thus living his life gently, quietly, and
        pleasantly. We shall not concern ourselves here by demonstrating the
        existence of his being, having already done it elsewhere, but we will
        simply notice that although Epicurus offers some just and reasonable
        concepts, he also offers some which are not tolerable among the pious
        – no matter, these he interprets in his own way and should be regarded
        as irreverent.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">For to believe that God exists, in such a way that
        Lucretius makes him out to be in these beautiful verses:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify">For whatever is divine must live in peace,<br>
            In undisturbed and everlasting ease<br>
            Not care for us; from fears and dangers free<br>
            Sufficient to his own felicity<br>
            Naught here below naught in our power it needs<br>
            Never smiles at good, never frowns at wicked deeds.</p>
      
        <font size="2">
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
        </font>
      
        <p ALIGN="justify">… to believe, as I was saying, in a sovereign being
        that exists for all eternity, has an immortal nature, is blessed,
        fortunate, in and of itself, nor has need of us, nor anything to fear
        because of what he is, and who is not vulnerable neither to pain, nor
        with anger, nor with other passions – these are undeniable truths.
        These beliefs couldn’t be more praiseworthy, particularly for a pagan
        philosopher. But to fancy shunning providence, as these same verses seem
        to do, or to believe that it is incompatible with supreme happiness, so
        that God does not particularly care for man, and that good people do not
        have any reason to hope for his kindness, nor do the wicked have any
        reason to fear his vengeance – these are such things that ultimately
        our good sense and right religion will not permit.</p>
      
<p ALIGN="justify"><i><a name="#1.3.2"></a>The second principle is in regards to
death</i>
      
        <b>
        –</b>  for death, in Aristotle’s observation, is considered to be
the most horrible of all evils, an inevitability from which nobody is exempt.
Thus, Epicurus professes that one must accustom oneself to think carefully upon
it, thereby learning to dispel, as much as possible, those terrors which could
disturb peace of mind, and consequently the happiness of life.</p>
      
        <p ALIGN="justify">For that reason, he endeavors to persuade us that it
        is so far from being the most horrible of all evils, that it is nothing at all. Here is his argument: death, he says, doesn’t affect us,
        and consequently it is not to be judged an evil in relation to us. For
        that which affects us is accompanied by sensation, but death is the
        deprivation of sensation. He tells us also, as Anaxagoras does, that
        just as it was not terrible not to have feelings before life, so too
        shall we not be troubled afterwards. Just as when we are asleep, we are
        not apprehensive, because we are not awake: so too when we shall be
        dead, it will not trouble us that we are not living. He concludes, as
        Archesilas does, that death, which is supposed to be an evil, has this
        appurtenant to it: that when it is present it has never troubled
        anybody, and when it is absent, it is only by the weakness of mind and
        through dismal apprehensions that we have of death that makes it seem so
        terrible to us – so much so that some are struck dead by the very fear
        of dying.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">We might admit here that death is the deprivation of
        external feelings, or of feeling itself. Epicurus is right to say that
        there is nothing to fear about death wreaking havoc by means of sight,
        hearing, smell, taste, or touch – as all these senses do not exist
        outside the body, which no longer exists, or is dissolved. But what we
        must disapprove of is that he maintains elsewhere that death is also the
        deprivation and extinction of the soul, or awareness, which is an
        interior sense, a sense which he includes. We shall not dally on this
        impiety, which was sufficiently refuted elsewhere by treating the
        immortality of the soul. We shall simply oblige ourselves to avoid these
        excessive horrors of death, and these terrors which often disturb all
        the leisure and peace of our life, and which by their gloomy darkness,
        like Lucretius knew, infects the purer pleasures:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify">---------------------------- Those idle fears,<br>
            That spoil our lives with jealousies and cares,<br>
            Disturb our joys with dread of pains beneath,<br>
            And sully them with the black fears of death.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Let us therefore first remember, in regards to that
        foolish desire to live forever, remember, I say, the feeble condition of
        our nature, and not to ascribe to it anything beyond its range and
        capacity. Let us enjoy, gently, calmly, peacefully, and without
        complaint, the present life allotted to us – however short or long it
        may be. We would have certainly been able to, without being wronged to
        be deprived of it, by giving thanks to the freedom in which we hold it,
        and count moreover our daily blessings.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Nature allows us of the use of its domains for a
        certain amount of time. We should not be distressed that it is necessary
        for us to leave when that time has expired. We are obliged to yield our
        place to others, just as others have had to yield theirs to us. Our
        bodies are naturally vulnerable to destruction – the condition of
        birth makes the condition of mortality necessary. “If it is sweet to
        be born,” to use Seneca’s words, “then let us not be sorrowed by
        our demise.” If rebelling against this necessity could serve some
        purpose, we should then approve of it; but it serves no use, and when we
        trouble ourselves so, we only make things worse.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">The number of our days is limited, our lifetime goes
        by irreversibly, we run the course, and whether we want it or not, we
        come finally to the end. As many days as we live, that much of our
        lifetime allocated by nature has already expired. As death is the
        deprivation of the life, we die as we live by a death which does not
        come all at once, but in parts that accrue bit by bit&nbsp; Yet, we
        only call the last bit “death.” Even so, it is true that the end
        depends on the beginning!</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">We thus moderate nature’s desires according to the
        same rules that nature prescribed, and if the Fates (to speak like the
        old poets) cannot be prevailed upon, so that in spite of us they hasten
        our death, at least we may soften their severity by going willingly.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">The one and only solution for living life calmly and
        without anxiety, is to adapt ourselves to our own nature, to want only
        what it wants, to count among our blessings even the last moment of
        life, and to dispose and prepare ourselves so that when death arrives,
        we can say: “I have lived, and I completed the course which nature had
        given me to traverse.”</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify"><i>Vixi &amp; quem dederas cursum natura pergei.</i></p>

        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">She calls me, but I come from my own accord; she asks
        for her payment, I return it readily to her; she orders me to die, I die
        without regret.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">We might also usefully take the advice of Lucretius,
        and say to ourselves sometimes, “The greatest and the mightiest kings
        of the world have died, and Scipio, the lightning of war, the terror of
        Carthage, left his bones in the ground like the meanest slave. The most
        pious of men, Ancus, and Homer, the prince of poets died. So shall we
        be distressed to die? You, whose life is akin to being half-dead, you,
        who pass more than half of your time in sleep, who snore, so to speak,
        subsisting on fantasies, and who live in anxiety, and continual frights.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">This is what our famous Malherbe was to have had in
        mind when he deplores the fate of great men who are being subjected to
        the same the laws of death as the lowliest souls.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify">Yet these are turned to dust, and fate<br>Rules with such arbitrary sway,<br>So binds its laws on every state,<br>That all their equal’s doom obey.</p>
            <p ALIGN="justify">With none ever yet impartial destiny<br>Of all its numerous subjects would dispense,<br>Hear this ye vulgar souls, and hence<br>Undaunted learn to die.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      
        <p ALIGN="justify">But here someone will object that we will no longer
        enjoy the blessing of life: no more country cottages, no more women, no
        more children, and no more friends with whom to make good times; alas,
        you say, one day, an unhappy day takes away all his delights! It is true
        that that is usually said, but one should add that this supposed
        unhappy man will not feel any desire for any of these things, and that after
        he has truly died, he will not see himself complaining with a broken
        heart and consumed by pain about his tomb.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">May we not likewise argue, as Plutarch does, what
        often occurs in our own thoughts? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>If
        our natural life, which we believe to be very long when it extends to a
        hundred years, were instead to last only one day, as those animals
        which, according to Aristotle, are born in the kingdom of Pontus, so
        that we were, like them, to enter adolescence in the morning, to be in
        the prime of life at midday, and to be in old age by evening, then it
        would be consistent in this case to be as satisfied with being able to
        live until the evening, as we are presently with living for a hundred
        years. And if, on the contrary, it were to be that one’s lifespan were
        a thousand years, like that of our first fathers, then one would be just
        as sorry to die in six hundred years as we would be to die in sixty. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>From
        this perspective those who came first into the world, if they had lived
        until the present, undoubtedly would not be sorrowed to die now, as we
        are.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">All that certainly must teach us well that life,
        whatever it is, must be measured not by the length, but by honesty, and
        the pleasantness which accompanies it, just as the perfection of a
        circle, as Seneca relates, needs to be measured not by the size of the
        circle, but by the exactitude of its roundness. “Oh vain and imprudent
        diligence,” Pliny says, “one counts the number of the days when one
        should seek only their value!”</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify"><i>Heu vana, &amp; imprudens diligentia, numerus
            dierum<br>
            Computatur ubi quaritur pondus!</i></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">We likewise take no notice that the mass of the
        Earth, and the whole of the world, and a thousand other worlds, if you
        like, are only a point if one compares them with the immense expanse of
        the universe. Thus the longest life of man, if it were as long as that
        of the Hamadryades, or a million times more, is but a moment when compared
        with eternity. If this life is only a point says Seneca, how far can we
        extend or elongate this point?</p>

        <p ALIGN="justify">“We know that by prolonging the life,” remarks
        Lucretius, “we do not reduce any time from the long duration of death.”
        He who dies today shall not be dead for any less time than he who died a
        thousand years ago.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">What if nature, he adds, should angrily speak to us
        about this in the following manner: “Why, oh mortal, do you have to complain so much
        about death? If your former life was pleasant to you, and if you have
        known to make use of the goods, and the delights that I have provided
        you, why as a guest do you not withdraw yourself full and satisfied with
        life? And why, foolish that you are, do you not accept the secure rest
        which is offered to you? If, on the contrary, life was tedious for you,
        and if you wasted my blessings, why would you request even more, only to
        waste them as well? For I do not have anything else to produce for you
        again, and though you might live to be a million years old, you would
        never see anything but the same things.” If nature, I say, addressed
        us in this manner, would we not concede that her reasoning would be
        right, and that she would be right to reproach us so?</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">At least it is necessary to concede that a wise man
        who has lived long enough to contemplate the world, must readily submit
        to the necessity of nature, at the time which he perceives that his hour
        approaches; and he must conclude that he has run his course, that the
        circle which is completed is perfect, and that if this circle is not
        comparable with eternity, it is at least comparable to the duration of
        the world.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">For having beheld the face of nature, he often
        contemplated the sky, the Earth, and the other things which constitute the cosmos. He had often seen the risings and settings of the stars;
        he has seen several eclipses, several other phenomena, the cycles of the
        seasons, and finally various individual creations, various destructions,
        and changes. And in regards to those things that relate to humanity, if
        he has not seen them, then he has at least heard about, or learned by
        tradition, all that has happened since the beginning of times: peace and
        war, trust and treachery, courtesy and cruelty, laws established and
        repealed, the founding and overturning of republics, and generally all
        the other things that he knows, and of which he is informed, as if he
        had been present at the time they happened.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">So he must think that all the preceding time relates
        to him, and thus his life began with the same things. And because the past
        is necessary to anticipate the future, he must still think that all
        the time which must follow all relates to him, in that there will be
        nothing in the future but what already is, that it is only circumstances
        which change. The universal flow of things always stays on its
        ordinary track, and always replays the same themes. So it is not without
        reason that the sacred texts pronounce, “The thing that has been, it is
        that which shall be, and that which is done, is that which shall be done
        again, and there is nothing new under the sun.” From this we may
        conclude that a wise man should not consider his life short, for by casting his eyes on the past, and by forecasting the future, he can
        do so as long as the duration of the universe.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Moreover, though Epicurus had reason to say, “There
        is hardly the slightest reason why a thing which will not sadden us at
        all when it is present, must upset us when it’s absent,” it seems,
        nevertheless, that there is still some reason to fear death, insofar as
        it can have some evils preceding it, or follow it; Seneca therefore
        attempts to compile some reasons to show that if death is not an evil,
        it nevertheless appears so much like an evil, that it cannot be casually
        shrugged off.

    <blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">It is certainly a great affliction to live in want;
        but there is nothing that obliges us absolutely to continue in it; for
        wherever we cast our glance, we may see the end of our sufferings, and
        our deliverance, either by a precipice, a river, a dagger, a tree, by
        opening a vein, or by fasting. We ought to give god thanks that none of
        us is detained against his will in this present life. The eternal decree
        has admirably well appointed that there should be but one kind of
        entrance into the world, but many out it. Death, say they, can be met
        with anywhere; god hath very wisely contrived, that any may take away
        our life, but no man can take away our death, for it has a thousand
        passages open to it.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify"><i>Ubique mors est; ptime hoc cavit dues<br>

        </blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="justify">He that knows how to die can free himself, and he
        always has the door of his prison open. True as it is, there is a chain
        that holds us fast – namely the love of life; and this love, though we
        cannot absolutely reject it, we should still at least mitigate it, so
        that if sometimes accidents require, it may not keep us back, nor hinder
        us from being ready to perform at present, that which we must one day do
        or suffer.</p>
    </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">These following points proceed from the same school. “The
        wise man lives as long as he ought, though not so long as he may; he
        knows where he ought to live, with whom, and ho, and what he ought to
        do. He considers the manner of his life, and not the length. If he meets
        with crosses, and misfortunes, he frees himself, and doesn’t wait
        until the last possible moment to set him at liberty; but as soon as
        fortune begins to frown upon him, he seriously considers, if he ought
        not at that time to end his days. He believes that if he himself hastens
        his end, or expects it from another hand, it is the same thing; or
        whether it be brought to pass sooner or later, it grieves him not.
        Nevertheless sometimes though his death is certain and appointed, and
        that he knows himself set apart for execution, yet he won’t lend his
        helping hand, nor will he be overwhelmed with sorrow. It is a folly to
        die for fear of death. If he that is to kill thee is coming, wait for
        him, why would you prevent him? And why will you undertake to execute
        upon yourself another’s cruelty? Do you covet the office of an
        executioner? Or will you save him the labor? Socrates ought to have
        ended his days by fasting, and die by hunger, rather than by poison, yet
        he continued thirty days in prison, in expectation of death; not because
        during this time he had hopes of a reprieve, but to show himself
        obedient to the laws, and to give his friends the pleasure of enjoying
        the conversation of Socrates, when he was ready to die. When therefore
        an outward violence threatens us with death; we can’t give any general
        or absolute directions, whether we are to prevent it, or to expect it
        with patience, for there are many circumstances to be considered. But if
        there be two kinds of death, the one full of grievous torments, the
        other sudden and easy, why might we not choose the latter?”</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">This was the opinion of Hieronymus, all the Stoics,
        and namely of Pliny, who fashions the name of “good mother” to the
        Earth, because having compassion of us, she instituted poisons. It is
        also supposed to be the opinion of Plato, for although Cicero makes him
        out to say “that we ought to preserve the soul enclosed in the body,
        and without the command of him who give it, we must not depart out of
        this life, that we might not thereby seem to despise this gift that go
        has bestowed upon man,” yet in his book of laws, he declares, “That
        he who kills himself is not to be blamed, but when he does the act,
        without being thereunto forced by the sentence of the judge, or by some
        insufferable and unavoidable accident of fortune, or by misery and
        public shame.” Not to mention Cicero, who in a certain place commends
        the opinion of Pythagoras, “because he forbids departure from our
        fortress, or to quit our station of life without the appointment of the
        general,” that is to say, of God. Yet elsewhere he teaches “that in
        our life we ought to observe the same rule, which is in the Greek
        symposia, that is to say, ‘either drink or depart;’ so that if we
        can’t bear the injuries and affronts of Fortune, we must accept them,
        by flying from them.” And Cato, who seems not to have fought death so
        much to avoid the fight with Caesar, as to obey the decrees, and follow
        the dictates of the Stoics, esteeming it his glory to observe them, and
        to leave his name famous to posterity, by some great and notable action;
        for Lactantius says, “Cato was during his life a follower of the
        vanity of the Stoics.”</p>
    <p ALIGN="justify">In regards to Democritus, “His opinion,” as the
        same Lactantius informs us, “was truly different from that of the
        Stoics; yet he suffered himself to die by fasting, when he found in his
        very great age, that the strength of his body, and the abilities of his
        mind began to fail. (<i>Sponte fue letho caput obvius obtulit ipse</i>) About which, we may say, is altogether criminal;
        for if a murderer is an offender because he kills a man, he that murders
        himself is guilty of the same crime, because he also kills a man. It is
        very probable that this is the greatest crime, whereof the vengeance is
        reserved to god alone; for as we do not enter upon life of our own
        accord, so neither are we to depart out of it of our own heads, but by
        his order, who has placed us in the body to inhabit there. And if any
        violence or injury be done us, we must bear it patiently, because the
        life of a guiltless person that is destroyed cannot be unpunished; for
        we have a powerful God, unto whom vengeance always belongs.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Finally, in regards to Epicurus, it is believable
        that he too disagreed with to the Stoics, for he says, “The wise man
        is still happy amidst his torments,” because, being tormented by
        gallstones which caused him extreme pains, he nevertheless did not
        hasten his own death, but awaited it patiently. Seneca, besides, says
        “Epicurus reproaches those who desire death as much as those that fear
        it; and that there is a great indiscretion, nay folly, in hastening our
        death, for the fear of death.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Yet it happens very often, as Lucretius said, not
        only because the excessive fear of death throws in some dark melancholy
        which makes one utterly discontented, and that one finally comes to the
        point of hating life as difficult, annoying, and unbearable, and at last
        seeks the strangest of ways for deliverance from it: procure death. But
        this excessive fear causes a certain imperceptible sadness, depressing
        one’s heart and spirits, disturbing all the functions of the life,
        impeding digestion, and ultimately brings on fatal diseases.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">In any event, the opinion of the Stoics not only
        conflicts with the sacred dogmas of religion (though it doesn’t
        disapprove of it when some persons, by a certain particular and divine
        instinct, hastened their own death, like Sampson and Razis in the Old
        Testament, and Sophronia, and Pelagia in the New Testament) but it
        moreover contradicts nature, and rationality. For nature gave a natural
        love of life to every kind of animal and all of them, except man, will
        endeavor to save its life and escape death no matter what evils torment
        it. It is hence remarkable that only man corrupts the institution of
        nature through his erroneous opinions, if he rejects the use of the life
        and procures death, he does so by a peculiar debasement.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">For the true state of nature should be considered
        like the general character of animals, and not of those individuals
        within the only species who procure their own destruction and are lost
        before their time allotted by nature. From which we should infer that
        they abuse nature, and its Creator, for although they are intended to
        undergo a certain course, they halt themselves in the middle of the
        race, and having been posted as sentinels, they desert and give up their
        station without awaiting the order and the command.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Reason, besides, consequently forbids the use of
        cruelty towards the innocent, who never did us any harm, and forbids us
        to be cruel to ourselves, from whom we never experienced hatred, but
        rather too much love. Moreover, on what occasion can virtue appear more
        advantageous, than when profusely suffering the evils that the hardness
        of fortune necessitates?</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">“To die,” says Aristotle, “because of our
        poverty, or for love, or for some other mischievous accident, is not the
        act of a man of spirit and courage, but of a mean and timid soul, for it
        is the act of a weak mind to shun and flee from things that are
        difficult to be endured. Stout men, says Curtius, are wont to despise
        death, rather than to hate life. It’s the trouble and impatience of
        suffering that carries the cowards to base actions, that makes them
        despised, and scorned. Virtue leaves nothing untried, and death is the
        last thing which we must encounter, but not as timid, lazy, and
        reluctant souls.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">I shall not linger upon the opinion of those “Who,”
        says Lactantius, “imagining that the souls are eternal, have therefore
        killed themselves, as Cleanthes, Chrysippus, and Zeno, expecting to be
        simultaneously transported to heaven; or as Empedocles, who cast himself
        in the night into the flames of Mount Aetna, supposing that by
        disappearing so suddenly, the world might think that he had gone to the
        gods; or, as Cato, who was during his lifetime a follower of the vanity
        of the Stoics; who, before he killed himself, as it is reported, had
        read Plato’s book of the eternity of the soul; or finally, as
        Cleombrotus, who after he had read the same book, cast himself down a
        precipice. This is a cursed and abominable doctrine, which drives men
        out of their lives.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">I shall also not dally upon that Cyrenaic of Hegesius,
        who preached, with so much eloquence, the miseries of life and the happy
        circumstances of souls after death, that the king Ptolomy was obliged to
        forbid him to speak in public, because several of his disciples,
        according to Cicero and others, killed themselves after having heard it.
        For the evils which we endure in life can well become so great, and
        multiply in such a manner that when the occasion to die presents itself,
        the loss of the life is not sorrowful; death is regarded as a haven in
        which one finds himself delivered from the miseries and tempests of
        life. But to press this exaggeration to the point of inciting a mistaken
        hatred for life is to be abusive and ungrateful towards nature, as if
        the gift of life that had been bestowed for our use must be rashly
        rejected, or as if we should not rather enjoy it, prolonging it so
        honestly and gently as possible!</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">It is true that what Theognis said formerly, “that
        it would be much better for men not to be born, or to die at soon as he
        was born,” was a celebrated saying. It is likewise demonstrated by
        Cleobis, Biton, Agamedes, Pindarus, and some others, who having
        petitioned the gods to reward them for their piety with something better
        and more desirable, were returned a very great favor: to die soon. Also,
        there is likewise a Thracian custom of crying for those who are born,
        and felicitating the dead. Not to mention Menander, who wished that a
        certain young man was dead, because he was liked by the gods.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify"><i>Quem diligent Dii, juvenis ipse interit.</i></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Nor to mention something of that celebrated
        pronouncement that nobody would accept life, if it were given to people
        who knew it.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="justify"><i>Vitam nemo acciperet, si daretur scientibus,</i></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">But, I ask you, who shall believe that Theognis and
        the rest spoke seriously, or without reservation? I say “without
        reservation,” because if one simply wanted to say that it was better
        for those who would be miserable all their life to have never been born,
        or if they would be born, to die immediately – that sort of thing
        would be in some way tolerable. But to apply this to everyone is to
        insult nature, who is the mistress of life and death that established
        and instituted our birth and destruction, just like everything else that
        consummates the universe; and one reveals oneself to have forgotten, if
        not of all, than at least of most of mankind, who are not displeased
        with life, and who seek all the care to preserve it. For life, as we
        already observed, always has something pleasant about it, and so he who
        maintains this kind of attitude will feel enthralled and saved. He
        would, I believe, resemble the old man in Aesop’s fables who sent
        death away, even though he had called for it, or another who refused a
        dagger that was presented to him, even though he had asked for it, in
        order to deliver himself, he had said, from a misery which was
        unbearable to him.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Certainly we may scoff at he who said that to live or
        to die was something indifferent, and who, when someone else objected,
        “why then don’t you just die?”, he answered: “Because it is
        indifferent to me.” – though I’m sure that if somebody with an
        unsheathed sword in hand obliged him to choose, he would have preferred
        life over death. Another answered all the more ingeniously, who, when
        one reproached him that although he made a profession of wisdom, he was
        still frightened by danger, answered, “you are rightly excused not to
        fear, your soul not being so precious; but me, I fear for the soul of
        Aristippus.” And another, who being already old, was reproached for
        having too much passion to remain alive, replied, “Having only lately
        acquired wisdom, I wish for some time to enjoy it.” Similarly, those
        who marry late wish for a long life to raise their children.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">But nothing is more memorable than what Cicero says
        about a certain Leontinus Gorgias, who having arrived at the age of a
        hundred and seven years, without ever stopping his ordinary work and
        occupations, answered those which asked him why he wanted to remain
        living so long?</p>

        hopes and to depend upon what might or might not be. Since fortune is
        shifty and fickle, nothing that results from its power can be foreseen
        or relied upon with much certainty. It often misleads those who look
        forward and rely on it. More surely, one should not absolutely despair
        about what one foresees, nor to regard it as something inevitable, but
        to somehow prepare for any event, so that if things turn out differently

        <p ALIGN="justify">This kind of maxim – neither too hopeful nor too

        it may also happen that they do not come to pass; meanwhile, he enjoys
        what is present, and remembers with satisfaction what has passed.” To
        this same purpose, he also says elsewhere, “that we ought not rashly despair in a mean, abject and cowardly manner, nor be
        overly motivated by excessive passion. Thus Epicurus, while
        speaking about the fool as opposed to the wise, knows that the life of

        reproach to mankind, for by delaying day by day, their life occurs
        unnecessarily, and in a constant dependence of the future.</i>&nbsp;
        “Consider,” Seneca says, according to Epicurus, “how pleasant it
        is to desire nothing, and what a greatness of mind it is to always be
        fulfilled, and not to depend upon fortune! Grab and secure the present,
        whereby you will have less occasion of dependence on the future.” By
        deferring the enjoyment of life, our life vanishes senselessly. <i>Dum differtur, vita transcurrit</i>.
        To the same purpose he says in Plutarch that “he who needs not
        tomorrow, nor wishes for it, comes to it passively;” as if he wanted
        to say that the wise man must reckon that if he considers each day of
        his life as the very last, and that which must achieve the circle:
        because in this way he will not defer pleasantness by the hope of the
        following day, and if he comes to the following day, that his day will
        be all the more pleasant, for it will be less wasted, until being higher
        than the roof, considered like a surplus, and esteemed as pure gain.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Pacuvius, viceroy of Syria, after having spent a
        whole day drinking the best and most expensive wines, had a tradition
        that each time he was carried off from the table, this music was sung to
        him: <i>vixit, vixit</i>, “he has lived, he has lived!”</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Horace, a little earlier, gave the same council. “It
        is necessary,” says he, “to think that each day is the last of our
        life;” the time that one does not take for granted will occur
        agreeably.</p>

        times and happy living have never arrived, that moreover what we desire
        is infinitely beyond all that we have enjoyed, or yet to enjoy. So we
        never appreciate anything throughout the past, and always look towards
        the future, as much in need of life as ever.</p>

        <p ALIGN="justify">It’s as if we don’t account for past pleasures
        and rejoice that they have been secured; which we should do all the more
        so because many others only hope for a similar fortune and their
        expectations are frustrated. We must do this piece of justice to
        Epicurus, says Seneca, “That he continually complains about our being
        ungrateful for the time past, that we call not to mind the good things
        that we have enjoyed, nor so much as reckon them among the real
        advantages and solid pleasures of life, because there is no delight more
        certain than that, which we cannot be deprived of.” <i>Praefentia bona
        nondum tota in solido funt, potest illa cafus aliquis incidere, future
        pendent, &amp; in certa funt; quod praeteriit inter tuta sepositum est.</i></p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Therefore Plutarch concludes, “That the nature of
        good consists not only in shunning evil, but also in the remembrance and
        in pleasing ourselves with the thoughts of things that have come to
        pass.” But to insist on ridiculous delays, one defers these things
        indefinitely.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">It’s a strange thing,” says Epicurus, “that
        considering we are born but once, that our days are to have an end, and
        that tomorrow is beyond our power, nevertheless we always put off living
        until tomorrow, so that our life is spent miserably in these continual
        delays, and there are none but die busied in such affairs as concern not
        their real happiness, for we occupy ourselves in everything else, but to
        live.” From hence proceeds that other just complaint of Seneca, “among
        other evils, this also attends folly, that it is always a beginning to
        live.” And Martial says, “You are for living tomorrow. Alas!
        Consider it is already late to live to day; he is a wise man who knew
        how to live yesterday.”</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Why do we consume our days in care, and in perpetual
        anxiety, tormented by needless fears, and blind ambition? We lose our
        life while seeking it, and without enjoying the end of desires, we
        always work to live, and we never really live.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify"><i><a name="#1.3.6"></a>The sixth principle regards
        greed, or covetousness</i>
        – knowledge of which is of such importance, that one must be mainly
        occupied with distinguishing those which must be known as natural and
        necessary indeed, and those which are useless and superfluous. For the
        happiness of life depends on the denial of the latter, and to simply
        sustain us with the former: but as we shall be obliged to speak about
        them in several other places, we shall satisfy ourselves for the moment
        to have simply mentioned them.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify"><i><a name="#1.3.7"></a>The last principle that
        Epicurus recommends us to consider, is properly an exhortation to carry
        on studying philosophy</i>
        – being the medicine of the soul. Because philosophy, if we consider
        the etymology of the word, is the study of wisdom, and wisdom for the
        soul – not only as a drug by which health is acquired and preserves
        itself, but as health itself. Indeed, just as the health of the body
        consists in a suitable temperature and quality of bodily fluids, thus
        the health of the soul consists in the moderation of passions.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">One only needs to listen to Cicero to appreciate the
        accuracy of this comparison. “All passions,” he says, “are
        regarded by philosophers as distempers of the mind; and they deny, that
        among fools, there are any that are exempt from these distempers. Such
        as they are distempered, they are not healthy;” he says, “therefore
        every one that is a fool is actual sick.” For according to
        philosophers, the health of the soul consists in a certain tranquility
        and unbreakable stability, and a soul that is not in this condition,
        they called a “patient.” However, it is necessary to suppose with
        Epicurus and others that usually there is nothing dearer, or more
        precious than the health of the body – which shows how dear and
        precious the health of the soul must be. Thus it is true (as we shall
        see) that the goods and evils of the soul are greater and more
        considerable than those of the body. Consequently, as the end of the
        happy life consists in peace of mind and in the comfort of the body (as
        we shall also see), there is more value in the latter; for he who has a
        tranquil soul, comporting with the rules of wisdom, greatly nurtures <i>temperance</i>,
        which is most solid and most assured supporter of health.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">“We must then,” says Epicurus, “act the part of
        a philosopher, not only in appearance, or out of ostentation, but
        effectively, and seriously, because what concerns us is not just to seem
        to be in health, but to really be so.” The young and old alike must
        apply themselves to the study of philosophy as it is important at either
        age to be healthy in mind and body; then one cannot reproach us, like
        Horace, that if we had the slightest thing stuck in our eye that caused
        discomfort, we would remove it straight away, and yet we defer years to
        cure our own spirit!</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="justify">We must, in regard to philosophy, not follow the
        example that Thales made in regard to marriage; for when his mother
        pressed him to marry, he could very well answer that it was not yet
        time, and later on, that it was too late; but just as it is ridiculous
        to say that it is not yet time, or that it is too late to heal the body,
        thus it is ridiculous to state that the time to philosophize, i.e. to
        cure the soul, has not yet come, or that it has passed; since it is
        precisely like he who would say, that it is not yet time, or it is too
        late to be happy. It is strange that time is thus unfortunately wasted,
        and that one does not apply something that is just as useful to the rich
        and poor alike, and when neglected, is as detrimental to young people as
        with old men. This is one of the reproaches that Horace made to himself.</p>

        <p ALIGN="justify">For it is the study of philosophy, speaks the poet,
        imitating Biantes, Aristippus, Antisthenes, Aristotle, and other
        philosophers, who call philosophy the money of old age. But to speak
        especially about what might persuade young people to study philosophy:
        there is nothing more excellent and more laudable than to accustom
        oneself early on with good things, and to adorn the beauty of youth with
        the softness of the wisdom, which is the fruit of a ripe age. There is
        nothing more pleasant than to prepare for and to be able to expect an
        old age, which, in addition to the ordinary fruits of maturity, can
        still shine and burst forth with the same virtues with which one shone
        and burst forth in youth, so that by the memory of beautiful and
        virtuous actions, as by its repeated presence, one rejuvenates, so to
        speak, continuously. In regards to those who are already advanced in
        age, it is consistent that wisdom is the characteristic and the true
        ornament of old age, that it is the singular support against discomfort,
        and the feebleness of age, and that it is what animates old men with
        youthful vigor.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">Here, it is necessary to listen to Seneca, who,
        already very old, went to hear the philosopher Sextus, just as the
        Emperor Antonius did so at a later time.</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">“Behold, this is the fifth day that I frequent the
        schools, and that I listen to a philosopher, who argues from eight o’
        clock. You may perhaps say, it is time indeed to study in our younger
        years. And why not in this age? Is there anything more ridiculous than
        to refuse learning, because we have not leaned a long while before?
        Shall I be ashamed to go and meet a philosopher? We ought to learn while
        we are ignorant, and according to the proverb, ‘as long as we live.’
        Go, Lucillus, and make haste, for fear that it should happen to you, as
        to me, to be obliged to study in your declining years; and make what
        speed you can, the rather because you have undertaken that which you
        will scarce learn when you come to be decrepit. But what advantage shall
        I gather, might you say? As much as you will strive for. What do you
        expect? No man becomes wise by chance. Riches may come to us of
        themselves, honors may be offered to us, and we may be advanced to
        employments and dignities, but virtue won’t come and see us; we must
        endeavor to find her, for she never bestows her blessings, but only upon such
        as take labor and pains.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="justify">These are the principles which the ancient
        philosophers, and mainly Epicurus, have recommended for our serious
        consideration, as being specific for us to discover and to pave us the
        way to happiness.</p>

      What kind of pleasure it is that Epicurus deems to be the goal of the
      happy life</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify"></b>It is astonishing that the word <i>pleasure</i> so
      defamed Epicurus, or as Seneca says, “that it made occasion for a fable.”
      For it is consistent that this term includes decent pleasures as well as
      sordid and debauched ones. I say that it is consistent, because Plato,
      Aristotle, and all the other ancient philosophers, as well as their
      disciples, say in so many words that among pleasures, some are pure,
      others are impure, some are of the mind, others are of the body, some are
      true, and others false.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">“We believe,” says Aristotle, “that pleasure
      ought to accompany happiness. And since it is confessed that among actions
      that are in accord with virtue, those that proceed from wisdom are more
      pleasant than the rest, as wisdom seems to contain pleasures that are
      pure, admirable, and fixed.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">“There is a delight,” says Cicero, “in
      contemplating great and mysterious things, and when there appears
      something recognizable, the mind is filled with sweet pleasure. In the
      discoveries of nature there is an insatiable pleasure, and those who
      delight in such pursuits often neglect their health and their fortune;
      they suffer all things, being captivated with the love of knowledge and
      understanding, and with great labor they pay for the pleasure they acquire
      by learning.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">I simply mention this because there are those who
      believe that the word <i>pleasure</i> can only be, or should only be,
      taken in its basest sense; thus, when Epicurus says that “pleasure” is
      the goal, they only take him to mean sordid and forbidden pleasures, so
      that when they read that among the philosophers some were called “voluptuous,”
      they presently mistake him for their chief.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">But to examine this more deeply, let us start with the
      accusation which is made against him. Among those who accept other
      pleasures than those of the body, there are some who suppose that what
      Epicurus speaks about must be understood as bodily ones. So let’s read
      his own words, such as they are recorded by Laertius, since this is where
      he expresses his opinion, and where he clearly declares what is the
      pleasure that he believes to be the <i>end</i> of life, or the chief good.
      “The end of a happy life,” he says, “is nothing else but the health
      of the body, and peace of mind. It is because all our actions aim and tend
      to this end, that we may be free from pain and trouble.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Having named <i>pleasure </i>as the <i>end</i>, some
      had used this occasion to slander him, saying that he meant sordid and
      bodily pleasure. For this reason he makes his own apology, and in order to
      do away such misrepresentation, he declares even more obviously what sort
      of pleasure he means and what sort he doesn’t. For having thoroughly
      recommended a sober life, which is satisfied with the simplest and more
      easily obtainable foods, he goes on to say, “When we say that pleasure
      is the <i>end</i>, we do not mean the sensual or the debauched kind, which
      terminate in the very moment of enjoyment, and by which the sense are only
      gratified and pleased, as some ignorant persons who are not of our
      opinion, or those being enviously bent against us, do thus interpret.”
      We only recognize it as this: “to feel no pain in the body, and to have
      no trouble in the soul; for it’s not the pleasure of continual eating
      and drinking, nor the pleasure of love, nor that of exotic delicacies, and
      delicious morsels of large and well-furnished tables, that make a pleasant
      life; but a sound judgment, assisted by sobriety, and consequently by a
      serenity and tranquility of mind, which thoroughly inquires into the
      causes of why we ought to choose or avoid anything; and that drives away
      all mistaken opinions, or false notions of things, which might raise much
      perplexity in the soul.” I could add in passing, something which we will
      speak about later, that the delights of Venus are never useful, and it is
      just as well if they do us no harm; but as for the topic at hand, this
      simple and clear clarification of his sentiments is enough to safeguard
      him from any accusation and from all condemnation.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Let us nevertheless note the difference in the
      comparison that Laertius makes between Epicurus and Aristippus. Because
      this comparison, or contrast, shows clearly that Epicurus believed no
      other pleasure to be the <i>end</i>, other than that which consists in
      stability, and as for the rest, to know comfort, and peace, while
      Aristippus endorses the pleasure of the body, and namely that which is in
      the movement, or by which the direction is currently moving and affected
      is the end. This contrast, I say, shows undoubtedly that the opinion of
      Epicurus is misinterpreted to be the same as that of Aristippus, in such a
      way that all reproaches that ought to be made towards Aristippus, and all
      the condemnations that ought to spill on him, are spilled on Epicurus,
      with almost none touching Aristippus. The illustrious argument of
      Torquatus by Cicero obviously shows exactly this – here are his words:</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">“I shall explain,” Torquatus says, “the essence
      and qualities of pleasure itself, and shall endeavor to remove the
      misconceptions of ignorance and to make you realize how serious, how
      temperate, how austere is the school that is supposed to be sensual, lax,
      and luxurious. The pleasure we pursue is not that kind alone which
      directly affects our physical being with a delightful feeling—a
      positively agreeable perception of the senses; on the contrary, the
      greatest pleasure according to us is that which is experienced as a result
      of the complete removal of pain. When we are released from pain, the mere
      sensation of complete emancipation and relief from uneasiness is in itself
      a source of gratification. But everything that causes gratification is a
      pleasure (just as everything that causes annoyance is a pain). Therefore
      the complete removal of pain has correctly been termed a pleasure. For
      example, when hunger and thirst are banished by food and drink, the mere
      fact of getting rid of uneasiness brings a resultant pleasure in its
      train. So generally, the removal of pain causes pleasure to take its
      place. Epicurus consequently maintained that there is no such thing as a
      neutral state of feeling intermediate between pleasure and pain; for the
      state supposed by some thinkers to be neutral, being characterized as it
      is by entire absence of pain, is itself, he held, a pleasure, and, what is
      more, a pleasure of the highest order. A man who is conscious of his
      condition at all must necessarily feel either pleasure or pain. But
      complete absence of pain Epicurus considers to be the limit and highest
      point of pleasure; beyond this point pleasure may vary in kind, but it
      cannot vary in intensity or degree.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">To also produce some more witnesses, Seneca must
      certainly be heard and credited before all the others, as being without
      doubt a character of great merit and great reputation, a saint of
      exemplary manners, and yet devoted to a sect which so misrepresented the
      words of Epicurus, that it is mainly responsible for all the vulgar
      ignominy that had blackened Epicurus instead of Aristippus.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">“According to Epicurus,” Seneca says, “there are
      two benefits required to consummate the chief good, or chief happiness, of
      man. The first is that the body should be without pain. The second, that
      the mind should be calm and sedate. These benefits don’t increase, if
      they are complete, for how can that which is full, increase? When the body
      is free from pain, what can be added to that freedom? When the mind
      delights in itself, and it is quiet, what may be added to this
      tranquility? Just as the serenity of the heavens is perfect, and can’t
      admit of any other new degrees of light, when it is absolutely clear and
      without the least shadow or mist, thus the condition of man is perfect,
      when he has taken care of his body and soul, making his chief happiness to
      consists in the advantages of both together in a freedom from all trouble
      of mind, and from all pain of body; for we may then say, that such a man
      has arrived to the full accomplishment of all this desires. And if besides
      all this, there happens to him an additional repose, it doesn’t increase
      his chief good, but it only seasons it. For this complete happiness, the
      perfection of human nature, is comprised in the calmness of the body, and
      the mind.” So let it be noted that Seneca expresses plainly and clearly
      the opinion of Epicurus, in accord with how it is presented in the text of
      Laertius.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Moreover, because Epicurus had given the name of “supreme
      pleasure,” or “chief good” to the comfort of the body and to peace
      of mind, those debauched sensualists of his time, fancying the above
      pretext and abusing the word of <i>pleasure</i>, commended themselves for
      having a philosopher as the defender of their debauchery. For this reason,
      Seneca speaks about them in his book entitled <i>Of the Happy Life,</i></p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p ALIGN="justify">It’s not Epicurus that compels or persuades them
          to luxury and debauchery, but being accustomed to these vices, they
          endeavor to conceal their vices under the cover of philosophy, and
          they flock together when they hear <i>pleasure</i> mentioned with
          praise. Without a doubt, it is not the pleasure of Epicurus which is
          esteemed and sought after; I know how sober and blameless that
          pleasure is.</p>
          <p ALIGN="justify">My opinion is (for I will say it in spite of them)
          that the things Epicurus teaches are fair and just, and have something
          solid and serious, if we consider them exactly; for his pleasure is
          reduced to very few things. He prescribes to it the very same rules
          that we do to virtue, and appoints it to be obedient to nature, which
          is easily contented.</p>
          <p ALIGN="justify">Will you then understand what it is? He who says
          that the happiness of life consists in idleness, in revelry, in lazy
          and wanton pleasures, and calls that happiness, seeks a good excuse to
          an evil cause. When he so flatters himself with the vagueness of the
          name, he follows not that pleasure which he hears praised, but that
          which he brings with him; and when once he begins to believe his vices
          to be consistent with the doctrines professed, he freely adheres to
          them, no longer disguising and performing them in secret, but boldly
          and openly, proclaiming them to the world.</p>
          <p ALIGN="justify">I won’t say what many don’t scruple to affirm:
          that the sect of Epicurus is the inspiration for infamous crimes, and
          lewd debaucheries. But this is what I will say: it is ill-spoken of, I
          confess, but without cause, and this cannot easily be discovered,
          except by more carefully scrutinizing the principal foundations of
          their opinions. The mere name of <i>pleasure</i> occasions the
          mistake, and casts odium upon it.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Thus, it is quite obvious that the chief good of
      Epicurus is not the pleasure which is in motion and in stimulation, but
      rather that which is in rest, and in the release from trouble.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">We could add the testimonies of Tertullian here, St.
      Gregory of Nazianzen, Ammonius, Stobeus, Suidas, Lactantius, and several
      others among the ancients, who, though not being particularly fond of
      Epicurus, did nevertheless say, that the pleasure Epicurus endorsed “was
      nothing other than a quiet natural state, and not a base and sordid
      pleasure.” Others have said that “between Epicurus and Aristippus,
      there was this difference: that Aristippus placed the chief happiness in
      the pleasure of the body, but Epicurus in that of the mind.” Others, “that
      the pleasure which disciples of Epicurus propose to themselves for their
      end, certainly is not a sensual and a bodily pleasure, but a quiet temper
      of the soul, which is inseparable from a virtuous and an honest life.”
      Others, like Lactantius, after he had abated from the ardor of his style,
      said that “Epicurus maintains the chief happiness to be in the pleasures
      of the mind, and Aristippus in that of the body.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">I have said, “among the ancients,” because after
      two hundred years, at the end of this barbaric era, we have among others,
      John Gerson, and Gemistus Pletho, of whom the former, after having brought
      back various opinions on happiness, said that there are some who holding
      that “the happiness of man consists in the pleasure of the mind, or in a
      peaceful tranquility of spirit, such as was that of Epicurus, mentioned
      often by Seneca, in his epistles, with very much respect. But as to the
      other Epicurus, Aristippus, Sardanapalus, and Mahomet, who placed it in
      the pleasure of the body, they were no philosophers.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Here it is necessary to pardon the ignorance of that
      age, and the common vogue, if he suspected that there were two Epicuruses.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The latter, Gemistus Pletho, took up the pleasure of
      contemplation, shows “that Aristotle taught no other position than that
      of Epicurus, who established the chief good in the pleasure of the mind.”
      However, it is not without reason that I insinuate that there has since
      come a happier age, which brought back the good letters that had been
      nearly lost. For then came an endless number of knowledgeable people who
      had better thoughts about this philosopher, like Philelphus, Alexander Ab
      Alexandro, Volateranus, Johannes Franciscus Picus, and many others.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">But what shall we say to those who charge Epicurus with
      holding an entirely opposite opinion? Nothing else than that which has
      been spoken in the defense of his life – to recognize that the Stoics,
      among others, who in portraying him as deathly evil for reasons which are
      expressed at large, not only wrongly interpreted his opinion, but having
      believed in their own misunderstanding, published on his behalf scandalous
      books of which they themselves were the authors in order to vindicate
      their bad interpretation, and to be able to elicit gossip against him with
      impunity.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Now one of the principal causes of their hatred was the
      fact that Zeno, their chief and leader of them, was naturally melancholy,
      austere, hard, and severe, and that his disciples, in the imitation of
      their chief, affected the same manner and severe countenance. Thus it came
      to be that the Stoic ethic, or wisdom, was decried as particularly
      austere. In this regard, they were admired and respected among the common
      people, and because one easily lets oneself get carried away with
      vainglory and vanity if one is caught off-guard, they imagined that they
      were the only possessors of wisdom. Thus, they boasted that only the wise
      man whose soul was nourished and strengthened by the virtue of the Stoics
      was fit to be king, captain, magistrate (these are their terms), citizen,
      rhetorician, friend, beautiful, noble, rich, etc. Such a person never
      repents – he was beyond compassion, beyond reproach, ignorant of
      nothing, never in doubt of anything, free from passions, always at
      liberty, always joyful, like God himself, and was attributed many other
      special qualities, about which Plutarch mocked that “the Stoics have
      taught things more absurd than poets!”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Epicurus on the contrary, as he was kinder and more
      humane, and because he acted with sincerity and plain-dealing, could not
      endure such vanity and ostentation. Furthermore, in observing the human
      condition and examining what it was capable of and what it was not, he
      recognized right away that all these great resounding promises of the
      Stoics, were not, if one revealed the structure and the pretensions of
      their words, anything but vain fictions. This is why he professed a virtue
      which he knew to be humanly possible. And he thus observed that all men,
      in what they largely do, were naturally motivated by pleasure, and after
      having examined all types of pleasures, he perceived that there is none
      more universal, more definite, more stable, and more desirable than that
      which consists in the health of the body, and in peace of mind. For this
      reason he declared it to be the end of all goods, adding that virtue alone
      was the true means of acquiring it. Thus he maintained that the wise man,
      or virtuous man, who by clear-headedness and self-constraint (i.e. the
      virtue of temperance) conserved the health of the body as much as its
      natural constitution permitted, and who, assisted by supportive virtues,
      calmed passions of lust, greediness, avarice, and ambition, and mainly
      strived to preserve peace of mind as much as possible. He also maintained
      that true pleasure did not consist in action, or motion, as Aristippus
      presumed, but in <i>stasis</i> and consistency, simply with neither pain
      in the body nor disturbance of mind, as we already said several times. So
      this was the simple manner and skill of how he acted, without worrying
      about gaining public adoration through splendid words, or a majestic
      posture, or displaying vanity in manners, as Zeno did, and without
      intending to deceive people, as he figured that nothing is more
      recognizable than flaunting something that one does not even understand,
      nor even practices. Now Zeno and the Stoics, understanding the simplicity
      of his manners and doctrines, and perceiving that a number of enlightened
      people were undeceived and could see through their grand and splendid
      words and promises, fostered such prejudice against him, that they always
      sought how to defame him. Seizing upon the word <i>pleasure</i>, they
      maintained that he meant sordid and debauched pleasure, and excessiveness.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">This is why one must not believe in what they say, nor
      the others, who, persuaded by their mendacity, are led against him. If
      there were some honest people who were also at fault, it is certainly
      because they had not ever entered the interior of his school, as Seneca
      complains, but that they only had forged books, or because they trusted
      the Stoics, his enemies, or finally because even though they were not
      unaware of his true opinion, they nevertheless believed that since it is
      not so easy to enlighten people, it was therefore useful to continue to
      defame this philosopher, in inspiring the abhorrence of vice and of
      debauched pleasure by the infamy of their pretended author, or defender.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">In particular regards to the Patron Saints, being that
      they only had piety and morality in mind, they preached strongly not only
      against sordid and debauched pleasures, but also against their authors and
      defenders. Because the rumor was already sprung that Epicurus was chief
      among them, they treated him according to common gossip. So it wasn’t
      their fault that he was defamed, since he already had been. What they did,
      as we have said, was only intended to inspire a greater abhorrence of
      vice, and of sordid and sensual pleasures.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">It is so true that some, like Lactantius, who being
      otherwise provoked against Epicurus, did not neglect to revise their
      opinion in its entirety. And Saint Jerome, among others, writing against
      Jovinian, does not place Epicurus among the number of those who ordinarily
      say “Let us eat, and drink, etc.,” but as a man very different from
      the common gossip: “It is wonderful,” the great saint says, “that
      Epicurus, the great patron of pleasure, fills his books with nothing but
      herbs and fruits, affirming that the plainest food is the best, because
      animal flesh, and other dainty dishes require a great deal of care and
      trouble to be prepared for our consumption, and that there is more pains
      in seeking them, than pleasure in abusing them; that our bodies have no
      need but of plain meals and drinks, that where there is bread and water,
      and suchlike necessities, we may thereby easily satisfy nature, but what
      is over and above is needless, and tends to gratify our lust; that our
      eating and drinking is not for delight, but to expel hunger and thirst;
      that wisdom is inconsistent with the laborious toil of procuring good
      cheer; that nature’s desires are soon satisfied, and that by a moderate
      diet and plain apparel we expel cold and hunger.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">There is one more passage which seems to be able to
      create difficulty; it is that which Cicero objects, as being drawn from
      the book “On the End” that is attributed to Epicurus; because he makes
      him say that “if bodily and sensual pleasures are taken away, he does
      not recognize the good.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">But could we just believe the Stoics, who dared to
      forge entire books and make Epicurus their author, might have maliciously
      inserted this passage in his book, and that this sort of counterfeit work
      arrived in the hands of Cicero, and Atheneus? A proof of this: in the
      first place, Laertius, who lists a catalogue of the books by Epicurus, and
      who should thereby know well enough what they consist of, when he relates
      a passage of the book “On the End,” and other similar works, says that
      “they are fools who impute such things to Epicurus,” as not being
      found within the authentic manuscripts. Hesichius attests that those who
      ascribe this passage to him are slanderers. In the second place, Epicurus
      himself complains about these words being assigned to him as being the
      total opposite, and which his disciples did not ever recognize that
      passage, which on the contrary they have always complained about, and
      railed against. Thirdly, that these repugnant words are obviously contrary
      with those of Epicurus: <i>Res Venereae nunquam prosunt, &amp; multum est
      ni noceant</i>, as we have already observed. Fourthly, that Cicero, among
      the objections that only he makes, is himself obliged to question it, as
      if the truth itself had compelled him to ask “are you to believe that
      Epicurus is of this persuasion, and that his opinions are sordid, sensual,
      and debauched? As for myself, I do not believe any of it; because I see
      that he says so many beautiful and highly virtuous things.” Fifthly,
      that Cicero acknowledges himself (as he was extremely popular) that he
      does not encumber himself in dense rhetoric according to the strict
      opinions of philosophers, but in accordance with the notions of the
      people. <i>Verum ego non quaero nunc quae sit philosophia verissima, sed
      quae. Oratori conjuncta maxime. </i>Not to say that he could not keep
      himself from speaking good of Epicurus, as being a man without malice or
      quite a truly good man. <i>Venit Epicurus Vir minime malues, vel potius
      Vir optimus. </i>And when he speaks of the Epicureans, he says that they
      are very good men, that he has never met with anyone less malicious; that
      the Epicureans complain of his endeavoring to speak ill of Epicurus; that
      whole crowds of Epicureans came frequently to visit him, but that
      nevertheless he does not despise them. <i>Quos tamen non aspernor;</i>
      these are his own words.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;<br>
      <b><a name="#2.2"></a>How Epicurus and Aristippus differ</p>
      </b>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Now to see how precisely Epicurus differs with
      Aristippus, one need only study Laertius. They differ, he says, firstly in
      regards to the word “pleasure,” as Epicurus ascribes it not only to
      that which is in movement, and stimulation of the senses, but also to that
      which he says to be stable, and permanent, and to consist in this
      comfortable repose that he calls <i>ataraxia kai aponia</i>, “tranquility
      and comfort.” Aristippus, however, ascribes it only to that which is in
      the movement, while mocking the tranquility and comfort of Epicurus as
      being like that of a sleeping man, or a dead man.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">They differ, therefore, in that Epicurus places the
      end, i.e., happiness, in that pleasure which is in stasis, (<i>in statu</i>),
      or in duration; Aristippus in that which is in movement, (<i>in motu</i>);
      Epicurus – in the mind; Aristippus – in the body; Epicurus includes
      the pleasures of memories of past goods, and the expectations of goods to
      come, while Aristippus places no value on them. But as we’ve already
      touched upon these things above, only a couple items remain to be
      addressed.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The first is that when Atheneus said that not only
      Aristippus, but that also Epicurus and his disciples embraced the kind of
      pleasure which is in movement, this relates to that slander which in time
      brought about the belief that Epicurus was of the same opinion as
      Aristippus, and which, according to same words of Atheneus, refers
      directly to Aristippus. These are his words: “Aristippus,” he says,
      “being wholly devoted to the pleasures of the senses judges those
      pleasures to be the end and happiness of life, and making no account of
      former enjoyments, nor of the expectation of any too come; he knows no
      advantages, but such as are present, as the most debauched persons do; and
      as those, who are immerged in delights.” However, I ask you, to just
      consider with this passage, all the different authentic testimonies which
      we have conveyed above in favor of Epicurus, and the authority of great
      men who also maintained that he was wrongly slandered, and by showing all
      that Aristippus really is, such as Atheneus depicted him, how far this
      philosopher must be removed from the manner of life and the doctrines of
      Aristippus! Furthermore, Aristippus had some notoriety of his luxurious
      life, because it is known that when he was reproached one day for his
      luxuries, his delicacy, and the great expenditure for which he incurred,
      he in no way concealed or excused it; he was satisfied to answer by a kind
      of aphorism – a mocking remark: “I enjoy Lais, but she doesn’t enjoy
      me; I live sumptuously, but if that were criminal, it would not be so
      often practiced at the festivals of the gods. I give fifty Drachmas for a
      partridge, for which you wouldn’t spare a half-penny; I buy a dainty bit
      dear, for which you wouldn’t grudge to bestow three half-pence. I
      therefore do not have so great a fancy for pleasure, as you have for your
      money.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The second thing that we must note here is that these
      words of Seneca: “I will never call indolence a good, which a worm, a
      cricket, a fly enjoys…” cannot be, nor should not be, understood as
      the same absence of pain, i.e., the pleasure that Epicurus places in
      stasis or in leisure; for he did not so endorse a state of idleness, or
      the leisure of a cricket or a worm, but rather a life as Seneca himself
      praises, and highly esteems, when he says, “Why wouldn’t the rest in
      which he will dispose and settle the ages to come, and will set an example
      to all men, presently and in posterity, be convenient for an honest man?”
      Or when speaking particularly of Epicurus, he says “Nor is that person,
      of whom we are wont to speak harshly, for maintaining a soft and idle
      pleasure, but for such as is consistent with reason.” As if he should
      describe it like that which Aristotle represents proceeding from a life of
      contemplation, or that state of rest and tranquility which is employed in
      speculation and meditation, and therefore ought not to be called idleness,
      and laziness; for contemplation is such an action, which alone consummates
      divine happiness. Besides, the same Aristotle declares, “action is not
      only in motion, but there is some in repose, and that pleasure consists
      rather in repose, than in motion.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">And what Seneca asserts, in speaking about pleasure,
      that it chiefly consists in action, is much to the purpose. “This
      pleasure,” he says, “is extinguished when the delight appears in its
      greatest strength; it is soon accomplished, it soon passes over, and
      becomes tedious after its first impression. Now that which comes and
      passes away so speedily, and perishes in the use, and in the very act, has
      neither substance, solidity, nor duration, but ceases the same moment that
      it appears, and in the very beginning it looks to the end, and perishes.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">It is true what Plato, speaking of this concern,
      maintains: that it may just as well be called <i>pain</i> as <i>pleasure</i>,
      “for just as it is a pleasure to pass from pain to this; so it is a pain
      and grief to fall from pleasure into the same.” Nor is it nearly so
      grievous, to cease from the enjoyment of pleasure in a case where no pain
      ensues, as it is gratifying to cease from being tormented with pain in a
      case where no delight follows; therefore this state is reckoned to be a
      state of pleasure, rather than of grief. This is what Torquatus means in
      Cicero, “I suppose that when pleasure is removed, nothing immediately
      follows that is uneasy, unless by accident pain follows after that
      delight. On the contrary, we rejoice to be delivered from pain, though
      none of those pleasures which gratify the senses follow; from whence we
      may infer, what a great pleasure it is to be free from pain!”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">But let us listen to Seneca, who contends that this
      condition is not only a pleasure, but the chief good of mankind.</p>
      <b>
      <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;<br>
      <a name="#2.3"></a>The condition and the joy of the wise man, according to
      Epicurus</p>
      </b>
      <p ALIGN="justify">“The Wise Man,” Seneca says, “is he who is merry,
      peaceful, and without anxiety, living content as the gods. Now examine
      yourselves, and notice if you are not often dejected, turned off, and
      sometimes carried away with overwhelming expectations and fervent desires,
      which render you anxious. However, if your mind remains always in the same
      even temper, day and night, consistent in respect of itself, always
      exalted and content – if so, you may then say, that you have arrived at
      the most accomplished level of happiness that men are capable of. But if
      you are still in pursuit of all sorts of pleasures, and seek them
      everywhere, know that in such a case you need as much wisdom as
      contentment. You desire to attain the chief happiness, but you are
      deceived, if you expect to procure it by the means of riches. If you seek
      delight among honors, it is to seek it among cares and troubles. That
      which you fancy will give you pleasure, is the origin and cause of a
      thousand torments. Pleasure and contentment are the universal desires of
      all men, but they generally are ignorant of the methods of how to obtain
      such contentment as may be fixed and permanent. Some seek it in feastings
      and luxury, others in riches and great offices and dominion; others in the
      favors and smiles of their Delilah’s, others in a vain ostentation of
      their learning and parts, which oftentimes stand the soul in little stead.
      Their short-lived and deceitful pastimes delude them, such as inebriety,
      which for the seeming pleasure of an hour, causes many months of real
      sorrow and trouble; or the applauses and acclamations of the people, which
      we have already purchased by much inquietude, and which will not fail to
      draw upon us as much more. Remember that a Wise Man ought to procure for
      himself such a satisfaction of mind that is always firm, constant, and
      consistent. His soul ought to be like that part of the world above the
      moon, where a continual serenity reigns. You have reason therefore to
      endeavor to be wise, seeing that satisfaction proceeds from his own
      conscience, and from his knowledge of being a virtuous man. It is
      impossible to enjoy this tranquility, unless we be just, magnanimous, and
      temperate. But then might you say, ‘Don’t fools and wicked men
      rejoice?’ – no more than lions, when they have found a prey. When such
      have spent the night in debauchery, when they have gorged themselves with
      wine, and consumed their strength in the courtship of women, and when
      their stomachs can no longer contain the quantity of meals they have
      devoured, they may then well cry out, ‘What miserable wretches are we!
      We now plainly see that this night has been spent in vain and deceitful
      pleasures!’”</p>

      <a name="#2.4"></a>That the pains, and pleasures of the mind are greater
      than those of the body</p>
      </b>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The last difference that Laertius puts between Epicurus
      and Aristippus is that Aristippus contends that the pains of the body to
      be greater, and more troublesome than those of the mind, and he contends
      that the pleasures of the body are much greater and more considerable than
      those of the mind; whereas Epicurus maintains the complete opposite: “in
      the body,” he says, “we can only feel things present, but the mind can
      sense things past, and to come. It is self-evident, that a great degree of
      pleasure or an extreme affliction of the mind contributes more to a happy
      or to an unhappy life, than much pleasure or much pain of the body. If the
      painful diseases of the body embitter the sweetness of our lives, those of
      the mind ought to render it even unhappier. Now the principal distempers
      of the mind are the greedy extravagant desires of riches, of glory, of
      dominion, and of sordid and unlawful pleasures. Moreover the disturbances,
      complaints and sorrows overwhelm the mind, so that anxious cares consume
      it, (etc.)”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">This seems to be what Ovid thought, when he reproaches
      us because we may endure cautery, the scalpel, and thirst to cure some
      malady of the body, but to heal our spirit, which is worth infinitely
      more, we can hardly suffer anything.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Certainly, as the mind is infinitely nobler than the
      body, and according to the opinion of Aristotle, is almost all that man
      is, it should be extremely susceptible to the impressions of good,
      pleasantness, or pleasure, or of evil, displeasure, or anxiety, and
      sorrow. Moreover the disorders of the mind are all the more dangerous than
      those of the body, which have recognizable symptoms, while those of the
      mind often remain hidden to us, which confounds us, so that we cannot make
      sound judgments. Thus, those who are sick in the body have recourse to
      medicine, while those who have an ailing soul find fault with philosophy,
      and refuse to obey its precepts. Furthermore, among the diseases of the
      body, the greatest and the most dangerous of all are those which cause
      stupor, and is not felt by the patient, like lethargy, epilepsy, and that
      burning fever which throws one into a delirium. By analogy, there are
      diseases of the mind of this kind which should not be overlooked, all the
      more so, as not only are they not recognized for what they are, but that
      they are concealed all the same with the example and with the pretext of
      the opposite virtues; fury and anger, for example, being called <i>strength</i>,
      while fear is called <i>prudence</i>. In short, sorrows, which are the
      pains of the mind, being a certain general disease which makes other
      diseases more unpleasant, sad and sorrowful, are taken to be nothing more
      than something caused without much provocation, and without reason. But
      one should not object, as Aristippus does, that one usually punishes
      criminals with pains, or corporal punishments, because they are greater
      and more unbearable. For the legislator, or the judge, does not have the
      same power over the mind as he has over the body, so he certainly does not
      directly order that the criminal’s mind be tortured, but rather he is
      corporally punished, to make an clear example out of him, presuming that
      it is necessary to restrain the populace through the fear of punishment.
      But it does not follow for that that there is not an altogether greater
      pain, or that mental suffering cannot still be an even greater torment.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Besides, when somebody is experiencing bodily anguish,
      or when one perceives that he will shortly be so, he imagines that he will
      be put to torture, or perhaps, that his head shall be sliced off, that he
      will be broken, that he will be burned, that he will lose the life, that
      it will happen in front of everyone, with much humiliation, bearing the
      eternal dishonor of his family and his dear friends, and so on. Do you
      believe that there can be any pain of the body, supposing that it can be
      separated from all that, which can be comparable with this kind of pain
      – this cruel mental anxiety? It is for this reason that I say that
      sorrow, sadness, pain, or the agony of mind was not ordered directly by
      the judges, insinuating instead that it is ordered <i>indirectly,</i> so
      that by occurring in the body, it makes the torment greater. Moreover,
      have we not seen, that the only threat and the only fear of the torment of
      death, which can cause one’s hair to turn gray overnight, a cold sweat,
      or even death itself, demonstrates well enough that their ultimate and
      greatest torment was not in the body, but in the mind? I have so far not
      even mentioned the pain and anxiety of mind that remorse, desire, or
      ambition cause in a scoundrel, a tyrant, or the avaricious; I will say
      only in advance that Juvenal, Horace, and Persius speak about it as if it
      were a greater torment than Coeditius, or Rhadamante had ever invented.</p>

      among the insane, having lost sense and reason, while brutishly exposing

      <a name="#2.5"></a>How Epicurus differs from the Stoics</b></p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Laertius also remarks how Epicurus was different than
      the Stoics, and how they greatly envied him.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">He writes that Epicurus, having said that virtue was
      desirable for the sake of pleasure, was by this occasion defamed by them,
      as if he had spoken about sordid pleasure and debauchery, objecting that
      “it was an unworthy and criminal thing to maintain that virtue must be
      sought, not for itself, but the goal of pleasure.” Among others, one
      named Cleanthes, to exaggerate the matter, and to render Epicurus more
      odious, made this depiction, with which Cicero chides Torquatus: “Just
      imagine (he said to his disciples) pleasure finely drawn, sitting on a
      royal throne, shining in very splendid and magnificent attire, attended by
      all the virtues, standing about her like so many servants, yet performing
      nothing else, nor fulfilling any other duty, than to advise her and
      whisper in her ear: ‘take heed that you commit nothing imprudently, and
      nothing that might offend the minds of men, or else some regret and
      displeasure may result.’”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">This is how the envy and jealousy of Cleanthes
      fashioned the pleasure of Epicurus. And that would be the worst of it, if
      somebody else had not said that “Epicurus had imitated Paris, when, of
      the three goddesses, he chose Venus, to whom he bestowed the golden apple,”
      as if Epicurus had only sensual pleasure in mind, beguiled by her tousled
      hair smelling of perfume and honey, her attire, her composure, and her
      eyes which breathed only ardor and lasciviousness.</p>

      <p ALIGN="justify">Instead, he ought to have imitated Hercules, who having

        <a name="#2.6"></a>That the virtues, according to Epicurus, are directed
        towards pleasure as the end of the happy life</p>
      </b>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Nonetheless, we need not dally to expunge Cleanthes’
      portrayal, nor to scrutinize what calumny and mischievousness had been
      thereby contrived. What has already been said is more than sufficient –
      especially since we clearly showed that the pleasure Epicurus advocates is
      not the sensual, sordid, and debauched pleasure that this depiction
      portrays; what he had in mind is very different, and very pure, i.e.,
      bodily comfort and, mainly, peace of mind. Thus, this kind of pleasure in
      no way whatsoever causes interference in seeking virtue, since it is in
      this pleasure that happiness, or the happy life, consists. Fortunately,
      Epicurus therefore advocates nothing else than what the Stoics themselves
      uphold, when they maintain that the virtue is enough to produce a good and
      happy life.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Certainly, this maxim alone shows plainly enough that
      whatever loophole or deception that the Stoics could seek, they
      nevertheless were describing virtue as something else, i.e., the <i>good</i>,
      and <i>living happily</i>. Thus, because the happy life is truly desired
      for itself, virtue is not as much desired for itself as is a happy life.
      However, when I say that they sought deceit, I include Seneca himself.
      Because to make pleasure only an accessory, or as something which
      accompanies virtue only by accident, like a small weed which sprouts and
      flowers between wheat – this seems trite and pretentious. It is in fact
      a perfect analogy to compare virtue with wheat, because just as one seeks
      wheat not merely for the sake of wheat, nor for the small weed which
      sprouts among it, but for the practical uses in life that one expects from
      it. Thus, virtue is not exactly sought for itself, or because of itself,
      nor for something insignificant coinciding with it, but chiefly for a
      happy life, or, which is saying the same thing, for the kind of pleasure
      that we have just talked about. Thus, when he adds, “you are mistaken
      when you ask me what motivates us to seek after virtue, for it is to ask
      for something above that which is the highest of all; I seek and desire
      virtue itself; I desire it for itself; there is nothing better; it carries
      with it a sufficient reward,” it is obvious that the question <i>is</i>
      fair, and incidentally, that one can say that when one desires something
      beyond virtue, one does not desire a ridiculous thing, or something that
      is beyond the highest and most elevated. It is true enough that of all the
      means that one can employ to make life happy, one shall not find anything
      superior, more certain, nor better than virtue; nevertheless, the happy
      life should be regarded as being above virtue, because virtue ultimately
      serves the happy life, or happiness, as its end.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Aristotle seems to be very precise about this point,
      when he speaks of that happiness which virtue above all things can
      procure. “It is,” he says, “evident that the compensation or reward
      of virtue is something very excellent, something divine and happy.” And
      elsewhere, “That happiness is not something that happens to us by a
      divine providence alone, but is something to be obtained by virtue, or by
      learning, or by our endeavors; there is nothing that could be more
      excellent, nothing more happy.” Additionally, he makes this distinction
      with Plato and Architas. “There are some things,” he says, “that are
      desirable for themselves, and not as a means to anything else, such as
      happiness; and other things are desired as means to something else, and
      not for themselves, such as riches; and other things are desired for
      themselves <i>and</i> as a means to other things, such as virtue.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">I cite this intentionally, to show what sort of men are
      opposed to Seneca when he shouts that the virtue cannot, nor could be,
      desired for anything but itself. And in doing so, one does not tarnish
      virtue; because insofar as we value pleasure, happiness, and the chief
      good, so much do we owe and honor virtue, which brings happiness.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">But we need not linger any more with these matters; it
      is enough to relate here what Cicero makes Torquatus say according to
      opinions of Epicurus. The passage is long, but it is very beautiful, and
      it explains, or even <i>decides</i> all these matters.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">When, after a long argument, it was concluded that
      whoever is wise, just, and honorable, tends to live pleasantly, and
      happily, Torquatus continues to speak thus:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p ALIGN="justify">That which is not itself a means to anything else,
          but to which all else is a means, is what the Greeks term the <i>telos</i>,
          the highest, ultimate or final Good. It must therefore be admitted
          that the Chief Good is to live happily.</p>
          <p ALIGN="justify">Those who place the Chief Good in virtue alone are
          beguiled by the glamour of a name, and do not understand the true
          demands of nature. If they will consent to listen to Epicurus, they
          will be delivered from the grossest error. Your school dilates on the
          transcendent beauty of the virtues; but were they not productive of
          pleasure, who would deem them either praiseworthy or desirable? We
          esteem the art of medicine not for its interest as a science but for
          its conduciveness to health; the art of navigation is commended for
          its practical and not its scientific value, because it conveys the
          rules for sailing a ship with success. So also Wisdom, which must be
          considered as the art of living, if it effected no result would not be
          desired; but as it is, it is desired, because it is the artificer that
          procures and produces pleasure. (The meaning that I attach to pleasure
          must by this time be clear to you, and you must not be biased against
          my argument owing to the discreditable associations of the term.) The
          great disturbing factor in man’s life is ignorance of good and evil;
          mistaken ideas about these frequently rob us of our greatest
          pleasures, and torment us with the most cruel pain of mind. Hence we
          need the aid of Wisdom, to rid us of our fears and appetites, to root
          out all our errors and prejudices, and to serve as our infallible
          guide to the attainment of pleasure. Wisdom alone can banish sorrow
          from our hearts and protect us from alarm and apprehension; put
          yourself to school with her, and you may live in peace, and quench the
          glowing flames of desire. For the desires are incapable of
          satisfaction; they ruin not individuals only but whole families, nay
          often shake the very foundations of the state. It is they that are the
          source of hatred, quarreling and strife, of sedition and of war. Nor
          do they only flaunt themselves abroad, or turn their blind onslaughts
          solely against other; even when imprisoned within the heart they
          quarrel and fall out among themselves; and this cannot but render the
          whole of life embittered. Hence only the Wise Man, who prunes away all
          the rank growth of vanity and error, can possibly live untroubled by
          sorrow and by fear, content within the bounds that nature has set.
          Nothing could be more useful or more conducive to well-being than
          Epicurus’ doctrine as to the different classes of the desires. One
          kind he classified as both natural and necessary, a second as natural
          without being necessary, and a third as neither natural nor necessary;
          the principle of classification being that the necessary desires are
          gratified with little trouble or expense; the natural desires also
          require by little, since nature’s own riches, which suffice to
          content her, are both easily procured and limited in amount; but for
          the imaginary desires no bound or limit can be discovered.</p>
          <p ALIGN="justify">If then we observe that ignorance and error reduce
          the whole of life to confusion, while Wisdom alone is able to protect
          us from the onslaughts of appetite and the menaces of fear, teaching
          us to bear even the affronts of fortune with moderation, and showing
          us all the paths that lead to calmness and to peace, why should we
          hesitate to avow that Wisdom is to be desired for the sake of the
          pleasures it brings and Folly to be avoided because of its injurious
          consequences?</p>
          <p ALIGN="justify">The same principle will lead us to pronounce that
          Temperance also is not desirable for its own sake, but because it
          bestows peace of mind, and soothes the hear with a tranquilizing sense
          of harmony For it is Temperance that warns us to be guided by reason
          what we desire and avoid. Nor is it enough to judge what it is right
          to do or to leave undone; we also need to abide by our judgment. Most
          men however lack tenacity of purpose; their resolution weakens and
          succumbs as soon as the fair form of pleasures meets their gaze, and
          they surrender themselves prisoners to their passions, failing to
          foresee the inevitable result. Thus for the sake of pleasure at once
          small in amount and unnecessary, and one which they might have
          procured by other means or even denied themselves altogether without
          pain, they incur serious disease, or loss of fortune, or disgrace, and
          not infrequently become liable to the penalties of the law and of the
          courts of justice. Those on the other hand who are resolved so to
          enjoy their pleasures as to avoid all painful consequences therefrom,
          and who retain their faculty of judgment and avoid being seduced by
          pleasure into course that they perceive to be wrong, reap the very
          highest pleasure by forgoing pleasure. Similarly also they often
          voluntarily endure pain, to avoid incurring greater pain by not doing
          so. This clearly proves that Intemperance is not undesirable for its
          own sake, while Temperance is desirable not because it renounces
          pleasures, but because it procures greater pleasures.</p>
          <p ALIGN="justify">The same account will be found to hold good of
          Courage. The performance of labors, the undergoing of pains, are not
          in themselves attractive, nor are endurance, industry, watchfulness,
          nor yet that much lauded virtue, perseverance, nor even courage; but
          we aim at these virtues in order to live without anxiety and fear and
          so far as possible to be free from pain of mind and body. The fear of
          death plays havoc with the calm and even tenor of life, and to bow the
          head to pain and bear it abjectly and feebly is a pitiable thing; such
          weakness has caused many men to betray their parents other friends,
          some their country, and very many utterly to ruin themselves. So on
          the other hand a strong and lofty spirit is entirely free from anxiety
          and sorrow. It makes light of pain, and slight ones have frequent
          intervals of respite; while those of medium intensity lie within our
          own control: we can bear them if they are endurable, or if they are
          not, we may serenely quit life’s theater, when the play has ceased
          to please us. These considerations prove that timidity and cowardice
          are not blamed, nor courage and endurance praised, on their own
          account; the former are rejected because they beget pain, the latter
          coveted because they beget pleasure.</p>
          <p ALIGN="justify">It remains to speak of Justice, to complete the
          list of the virtues; but this admits of practically the same treatment
          as the others. Wisdom, Temperance and Courage I have shown to be so
          closely linked with Pleasures that they cannot possibly be severed or
          sundered from it. The same must be deemed to be the case with Justice.
          Not only does Justice never causes anyone harm, but on the contrary it
          always adds some benefit, partly owning to its essentially
          tranquilizing influence upon the mind, partly because of the hope that
          it warrants of a never-failing supply of the things that uncorrupted
          nature really needs. And just as Rashness, License and Cowardice ever
          torment the mind, ever awaken trouble and discord, so Unrighteousness,
          when firmly rooted in the heart, causes restlessness by the mere fact
          of its presence; and if once it has found expression in some deed of
          wickedness, however secret the act, yet it can never feel assured that
          it will always remain undetected. The usual consequences of crime are,
          first suspicion, next gossip and rumor, then comes the accuser, then
          the judge; many wrongdoers have even turned in evidence against
          themselves, as happened during your consulship. And even if any think
          themselves well fenced and fortified against detection by their
          fellow-men, they still dread the eye of heaven, and fancy that the
          pangs of anxiety night and day gnawing at their hearts are sent by
          Providence to punish them. But what can wickedness contribute towards
          lessening the annoyances of life, commensurate with its effect in
          increasing them, owing to the burden of a guilty conscience, the
          penalties of the law and the hatred of one’s fellows? Yet
          nevertheless some men indulge without limit their avarice, ambition
          and love of power, lust gluttony and those other desires, which
          ill-gotten gains can never diminish but rather must inflame the more,
          insomuch that they appear proper subjects for restraint rather than
          for reformation. Men of sound natures, therefore, are summoned by the
          voice of true reason to justice, equity and honesty. For one without
          eloquence or resources, dishonesty is not good policy, since it is
          difficult for such a man to succeed in his designs, or to make good
          his success when once achieved. On the other hand, for the rich and
          clever generous conduct seems more in keeping, and liberality wins
          them affection and good will, the surest means to a life of peace;
          especially as there really is no motive for transgressing: since the
          desires that spring from nature are easily gratified without doing any
          man wrong, while those that are imaginary ought to be resisted, for
          they set their affections upon nothing that is really wanted; while
          there is more loss inherent in Injustice itself than there is profit
          in the gains it brings. Hence Justice also cannot correctly be said to
          be desirable in and for itself; it is so because it is so highly
          productive of gratification. For esteem and affection are gratifying,
          because they render life safer and fuller of pleasure. Hence we hold
          that Unrighteousness is to be avoided not simply on account of the
          disadvantages that result from being unrighteous, but even far more
          because when it dwells in a man’s heart it never suffers him to
          breath freely or know a moment’s rest.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="justify">I could mention here the objections which are made
      against this opinion, but they are merely aimed at those sordid and
      debauched pleasures that Epicurus rejects in express words.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">I only take notice of the sort of pleasure which is
      hereby under consideration — the proper and natural pleasure which
      comprises the chief good, and happiness; for this reason one says that the
      virtue alone is inseparable from it, because it is its only real,
      legitimate, and necessary cause. When it is present, pleasure, and
      happiness follow; and when removed, pleasure, happiness are necessarily
      removed – just as the sun alone is recognized as being inseparable from
      day, because it is the only real and necessary cause of the day. However
      the reason why Epicurus proposed that virtue was the direct cause
      happiness is that he believed that prudence was, in a sense, <i>all</i>
      the virtues; insofar as the other virtues are born from prudence, and have
      a necessary connection to it.

        What makes a happy life</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      
        </b>So far we have done little else than to bring Epicurus’ opinions 
        into full view.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Now we must advance the matter 
        further.&nbsp; To see whether or not he had a reason to say that pleasure is 
        the <i>end</i>, it is first necessary to examine two of his principal 
        maxims.&nbsp; One is that any pleasure is in itself a natural good while any 
        pain is an evil.&nbsp; The other is that nevertheless certain pains are 
        sometimes required to be chosen over certain pleasures.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><a name="3.2"></a>&nbsp;<br>
        Whether all pleasure is good in and of itself</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In regards to the first maxim, it 
        is reasonable that Epicurus asserts that any pleasure is good in and of 
        itself, though by accident some of them turn out to be bad.&nbsp; For any 
        creature, by its nature, seems to be so inclined towards pleasure (or 
        gratification) that it is the foremost thing which it naturally 
        desires.&nbsp; There is no pleasure that it refuses, as long as it is not 
        accompanied by some evil which would then cause it pain, and make it 
        regret choosing the pleasure.&nbsp; And certainly, as the nature of good 
        consists of inspiring the desire to like it, and to pursue it, one 
        cannot say why any pleasure, or any pleasure of itself, is not pleasant 
        and desirable.&nbsp; Thus, there is no pleasure in itself that one does not 
        like – that is not pleasant and appetizing. &nbsp;So if we reject some of 
        them, it is not exactly pleasure that we reject, but the consequential 
        nuisances that are connected with it.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">To make an example: nobody would 
        disagree that honey is naturally sweet; nevertheless, if one happened to 
        mix poison into it so that the poison was sweetened, then we truly would 
        have an aversion for the sweetness of honey.&nbsp; But this would be by 
        accident, because it is still by its own nature delightful and 
        appealing. &nbsp;Thus, one can say that if we have such an aversion, it is 
        not really for sweetness itself.&nbsp; It is caused instead by the harm of 
        the poison mixed into it, for if the poison was separated from it, we 
        would be quite willing to taste it.&nbsp; Apply any sort of pleasure to this 
        example, and you will notice that it will never turn out otherwise: the 
        harm shall never come from the pleasure itself, but rather from the 
        thing from which it shall be obtained, or a consequence which 
        accompanies it, or the injury which shall result either from the thing 
        or from the consequence, or the pain which shall follow the thing, the 
        consequence, or the injury.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">To make this point even more 
        obvious, suppose that a particular kind of pleasure can be come from a 
        thing or action, that neither law, custom, nor honor prohibit.&nbsp; Suppose 
        that from this thing or action, no loss of health, fame, or benefits 
        results. Finally, suppose that it entails no pain, reprimand, or 
        repentance – either in the present life or in the hereafter.&nbsp; You will 
        clearly recognize that nothing precludes it from being considered a 
        good.&nbsp; If it is not considered such, then this is not because of its 
        nature, but because of the kinds of qualifications that I have mentioned 
        above.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Aristotle also proves this by 
        reasoning that pain is the opposite of pleasure. &nbsp;“Everyone,” he says, 
        “agrees that pain is a bad thing and should be avoided.”&nbsp; Now, to build 
        upon Aristotle’s reasoning, is it not obvious that any pain is generally 
        evil and hurtful in and of itself, so that any animal has a natural 
        aversion to it?&nbsp; So if it sometimes is known as a good, it is only so by 
        accident, and because it happens to have a good attached to it, which 
        makes us like and embrace it.&nbsp; But if you remove from such pain any hope 
        of obtaining any honest, practical, or pleasant benefit from it, would 
        there be a man foolish enough to desire it and who would elect to go 
        after it?&nbsp; Isn't it so obvious that if any pain is an evil in itself, 
        though not one by accident, then any pleasure, being the opposite of 
        pain, is a good in itself, and is an evil only by accident?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Some would object that a temperate 
        man flees pleasures, and he who is prudent seeks only freedom from pain 
        instead; that there are some pleasures which are impediments to 
        prudence, especially those that are intense, as are generally the 
        pleasures of love; that there are some pleasures which not only are 
        harmful, in how they dull one’s awareness, generate diseases, and cause 
        poverty, but are also debauched and infamous.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">First off, those who are temperate 
        and those who are prudent do not flee all pleasures, for sometimes they 
        evidently pursue those pleasures which are pure and honorable.&nbsp; And even 
        if they flee some of them, they do not flee them just because they are 
        pleasures, but because they are linked to consequential harm, so that a 
        prudent and temperate man would not be seduced by the enjoyment of such 
        pleasure when presented, in the same way that one regards poison that 
        has been sweetened: not because it is sweet, but because it brings harm, 
        which assuredly does not deserve acceptance for its sweetness.&nbsp; 
        Accordingly, pleasures alone do not hinder prudence, but rather the 
        consequences which accompany them – consequences, I say, by which one’s 
        spirits are exhausted, the strength of understanding is weakened, and 
        judgment is clouded. &nbsp;So when these evils are attributed to pleasure, it 
        is a fallacy which Aristotle calls <i>non causae ut causae</i> (that 
        which is not the cause, taken as the cause), just as when the harm that 
        should be attributed to the poison is attributed to the honey, or its 
        sweetness.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">As for diseases, poverty, and other 
        inconveniences which commonly accompany pleasure – pleasure, simply 
        considered in itself, is not the cause of these evils.&nbsp; It is gluttony, 
        or the excessive consumption of wine and meats prepared with sauces, 
        that results in indigestion, fevers, and other inconveniences.&nbsp; By 
        tempting us to exceed the bounds of moderation, these notorious maladies 
        (and so many others) result.&nbsp; Thus, it is ordinarily thought that 
        pleasure is disreputable, because only the eventualities that accompany 
        it are taken into account, which are themselves contrary to good manners 
        and have a bad and shameful reputation.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">It is also for this reason that the 
        law, for example, does not forbid the <i>pleasure</i> of adultery, but 
        rather the <i>act</i> of adultery.&nbsp; It is because of the act, being 
        forbidden and scandalous, that the pleasure which accompanies it is also 
        supposed forbidden and scandalous.&nbsp; Suppose, however, that there was no 
        law against it, as in the state of pure nature.&nbsp; Suppose it so happened 
        that a married woman was the lover of the present adulterer.&nbsp; He would 
        have enjoyed the same pleasure, but would nevertheless avoid being 
        defamed as wicked because the act of partaking in such pleasure was 
        neither forbidden nor disgraced.&nbsp; This nicely demonstrates that pleasure 
        is not itself is not blameworthy, but rather the act which accompanies 
        it.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Some may still object that just 
        because pleasure is not an evil, it is nevertheless more useful to count 
        it among evils because the populace, being inclined towards pleasure, 
        ought to be bent, like crooked trees, in the opposite way so that they 
        can be brought back into good standing.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">But Aristotle counters that it is 
        not productive to use these kinds of arguments with people, because when 
        it concerns passions and actions (as in this case), one does not give 
        more credence to words than to the thing itself.&nbsp; When it happens that 
        words do not agree with what is apprehended by the senses, they are 
        discounted, and even if they contain some hidden good, they are 
        detrimental.&nbsp; This is why Aristotle seems to insinuate that it is best 
        not to make much of counting pleasure among evils, since one’s 
        inclination is obviously opposed to the idea precisely because it 
        approves of pleasure and holds it to be good.&nbsp; Rather, one should make 
        known and emphasize the evils which accompany or follow some pleasures, 
        the lesson being that a prudent and temperate man would rather abstain 
        from these kinds of pleasures, because eventually great evils result.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">If this response inspired by 
        Aristotle does not satisfy, then nothing can inhibit us from arguing 
        against pleasure itself, and being heard to speak about pleasures which 
        cause much more evil than they contain any good.&nbsp; For the sake of the 
        argument, it is then just as useful to hear that pleasure or the action 
        which accompanies pleasure is bad, in order to infer that one or the 
        other is to be fled because of the evils which, by connection, follow 
        one or the other.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>&nbsp;<a name="3.3"></a><br>
        Whether the opinion of the Stoics, in respect to Good and Evil, is 
        justifiable</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">We could, at this point, argue 
        against the Stoics, who pretend that there is no other good than that 
        which is “honest,” and no other evil than that which is “dishonest;” but 
        that would be dallying on empty words, since it all boils down to 
        semantics.&nbsp; For they have limited these concepts in their own 
        imagination – even though all of mankind holds them to be more generally 
        applicable.&nbsp; For most people count many things besides virtues as goods, 
        like health, pleasure, glory, wealth, friends; and they count many 
        things besides vices as evil, like disease, pain, disgrace, poverty, 
        enemies, etc.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The Stoics preferred to call these 
        things indifferent – neither good nor bad – and because it was so 
        obviously absurd to maintain the equivalence of health and disease, 
        pleasure and pain, etc., they were obliged to coin new terms, and to 
        name health, pleasure, glory, and the others <i>&#960;&#961;&#959;&#942;&#947;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;</i> (<i>promota 
        – </i>“assistants”), meaning that they were truly not goods, but such 
        things that closely approached virtue, which was the chief and unique 
        good.&nbsp; They did likewise for disease and pain, naming them <i>
        &#945;&#960;&#959;&#960;&#961;&#959;&#942;&#947;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;</i> (<i>Abducta remota</i>), which meant less noble things 
        further away from the virtue, because whenever it is a matter of choice, 
        those are preferred, but these are forsaken.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This is the way of their doctrine, 
        but I would be ashamed to answer them in any other way than how Cicero 
        does, when he exclaims, “Oh what great strength of mind, and what 
        justification to create new doctrines!&nbsp; <i>(O magnam vim ingenii causamq; 
        justam cur nova existeret disciplina!) &nbsp;</i>The Stoics argue, and with 
        their weak reasoning, would maintain that pain is no evil <i>(Concludunt 
        ratiunculis Stoici cur dolor non sit malum, etc.)</i>, as if men were 
        only troubled about the word, and not the thing itself!&nbsp; Why must you, 
        Zeno, deceive me with your subtle niceties, and newfangled words <i>
        &#960;&#961;&#959;&#942;&#947;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;</i> and <i>&#945;&#960;&#959;&#960;&#961;&#959;&#942;&#947;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#945;; </i>for when you tell me that what 
        looks grievous is no Evil, you put me on the stand.&nbsp; I would desire to 
        know how that which seems to me most prejudicial and hurtful, is no Evil 
        in itself.&nbsp; Nothing is Evil, as you pretend, but that which is dishonest 
        and vicious.&nbsp; These are but words; neither can you hereby remove the 
        difficulty.&nbsp; I understand very well, that Pain and Grief are not 
        criminal Evils.&nbsp; You need not trouble yourself to tell me that; but show 
        me whether it be an indifferent thing to suffer pain, or to be free from 
        it.&nbsp; You say that it is different, as to the happiness of life, seeing 
        that consists in virtue alone: but in the meanwhile, what you call pain 
        is to be reckoned amongst those things that you are to avoid, and by 
        consequence is an evil.&nbsp; When you pretend that pain is no real evil, but 
        only something uneasy to be suffered, etc., it is to speak at large what 
        everyone else names in one word, <i>Evil</i>.&nbsp; And when you say that 
        ‘there is nothing good, but what is honest,’ and ‘nothing Evil, but what 
        is dishonest,’ it is to vanquish in words, but not in sense; it is to 
        express desires, and prove nothing.&nbsp; Doubtless, this is an undeniable 
        truth: all that nature hates, ought to be esteemed in the number of 
        evils; and all that is grateful to it, is to be reckoned on the 
        contrary.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><a name="3.4"></a>&nbsp;<br>
        Whether one might prefer pain over pleasure on occasion</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The second thing which must be 
        examined before reaching a conclusion about the opinion of Epicurus is: 
        if it is sometimes necessary to forsake pleasure for pain.&nbsp; It is a 
        question that depends entirely upon the preceding one.&nbsp; For if there is 
        an prospect for pleasure of the kind that Plato called “pure, and 
        separated from grief and trouble,” i.e., such that it must never bring 
        any consequential pain, neither presently nor in the future, not in this 
        life nor in the hereafter, one has every reason to embrace it.&nbsp; And if 
        there is a prospect for pain which could also be known as “pure,” 
        separated from any pleasure and which could never be followed by any 
        pleasure, it is reasonable to avoid it.&nbsp; Conversely, if there is a 
        prospect for pleasure which happens to be an obstacle to obtaining some 
        greater pleasure, or which has painful consequences that are justifiably 
        regrettable, it is also reasonable to avoid it.&nbsp; And if a prospect 
        entailing some pain would circumvent some greater pain, or would bring 
        on a considerable amount of pleasure, it is reasonable to embrace it.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This is why, as even Aristotle saw, 
        that pleasure and pain are the criteria, the standard, or the scale by 
        which one must judge if a thing should be accepted or avoided.&nbsp; So, 
        anyone who is wise will abandon pleasure, or accept pain, if he sees 
        that a regrettable consequence will follow a particular pleasure, or 
        that by accepting some minor pain he will thereby avoid a greater one.&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;Torquatus explains it clearly:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="justify">I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea 
            of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose. To do so, I will 
            give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual 
            teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of 
            human happiness [Epicurus]. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids 
            pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do 
            not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences 
            that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or 
            pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but 
            because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can 
            procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of 
            us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain 
            some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a 
            man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying 
            consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant 
            pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation 
            and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of 
            the pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot 
            foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal 
            blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of 
            will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and 
            pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a 
            free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing 
            prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is 
            to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain emergencies 
            and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it 
            will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and 
            annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these 
            matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to 
            secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid 
            worse pains.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">We may add the general consent of 
        Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle, who all make use of the same standard 
        and the same criterion.&nbsp; And even Cicero supposes that one thinks about 
        it as if all pleasures and all displeasures, either present or to come, 
        were put in front of you, as if one weighs the balance by hand.&nbsp; For he 
        says, “If you weigh present pleasures with future one, we are always to 
        choose the greatest and the most plentiful; but if we weigh evils with 
        evils, we choose the least and the fewest.&nbsp; But if you weigh present 
        pleasures with future evils, or present evils with future pleasures, in 
        such a case, you should choose the pleasures if they tip the balance, 
        but not if the evils do.”</p>

        On the chief good intended by nature</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Coming finally to Epicurus’ opinion 
        that pleasure is the <i>end,</i> it should be noted that the reasoning 
        which brought him to this conclusion is partly because he considers 
        pleasure as simply and plainly self-evident, and partly because he 
        considers that it must be managed by the intellect.&nbsp; Hence, Alexander 
        observes that the matter should be distinguished, when he says that 
        “pleasure, according to Epicurus, is truly the chief good that nature 
        prescribes, or the chief good to which we are naturally inclined, but 
        afterwards this pleasure is kept in order, and directed by wisdom and 
        prudence.” (<i>Effe quidem voluptatem ex mente Epicuri primum familiare, 
        primum, et congenitum bonum, primum aptum accomodatumque naturae; verum 
        deinceps quasi in ordinem redigi talem voluptatem.</i>)&nbsp; We will speak 
        later on about this last part, which for Epicurus is nothing other than 
        freedom from pain and peace of mind.&nbsp; Let us now say something about the 
        first part, and see whether this self-evident pleasure is indeed the <i>
        primum naturae familiare,</i> or the first and chief good that nature 
        requires.&nbsp; For it is a great question among philosophers, and it 
        moreover seems that within the range of the goods which are desirable, 
        there should indeed be an ultimate good – which may be the beginning of 
        all our desires.&nbsp; “Some,” Cicero says, “conceive of pleasure or delight 
        to be the first good, others an exemption, or a freedom from pain; for 
        as soon as any creature is born, it naturally desires and seeks freedom 
        from pain.&nbsp; Others place the chief goods of nature amongst those things 
        called our ‘being,’ ‘life,’ ‘integrity,’ i.e., the preservation of our 
        entire body, or our health, senses, strength, beauty, and so forth.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Now among these opinions, the first 
        and second are included by Epicurus, as he counts among pleasures the 
        exemption of pain.&nbsp; The third, which the Stoics propound, seems the 
        least probable, because no matter what one might say about an animal’s 
        desire for its being, life, health, integrity, and preservation of its 
        body, etc., we must nevertheless clearly see that all these things were 
        desired only because it is pleasurable to enjoy them.&nbsp; Thus it is for 
        the sake of pleasure that these things are desired.&nbsp; Consequently, 
        pleasure is the chief good, i.e., it holds the first rank among 
        everything desirable.&nbsp; And this is apparently what Aristotle meant when 
        he says, that “pleasure is common to all living creatures, and the 
        inseparable companion of our free and voluntary actions.&nbsp; For we 
        perceive that what is honest, is pleasurable, as well as what is 
        practical.&nbsp; Besides, pleasure is born and bred up with us from our very 
        cradle.&nbsp; Therefore it is futile to endeavor to wean ourselves from this 
        inclination, with which our natures are naturally constituted.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This plainly reveals two things.&nbsp; 
        First, although we commonly recognize three kinds of goods – the <i>
        honest</i>, the <i>practical</i>, and the <i>pleasant</i> – it is the 
        pleasant, (which is nothing other than pleasure itself) that is 
        intermixed with the others, so that it does not seem so much to be a 
        particular type, distinct from the others, but rather a common type, or 
        a common property which causes the others to be goods, or desirables.&nbsp; 
        So that what is honest or practical is desired only because it is 
        pleasant and agreeable.&nbsp; The other thing is that pleasure, being common 
        to all the animals, and being planted within since tender youth, and 
        moreover inseparable from choosing anything, it justifiably seems to be 
        the first of all goods that are desired (<i>primum expetibile, primum 
        familiare;</i> for these are the ordinary terms, <i>primum expetitum 
        accomodatumq; naturae.</i>)</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Epicurus therefore seems to have 
        dealt more candidly and sincerely than all the rest, when he declared 
        that pleasure “<i>est primum naturae accomodatum;</i> and that it is 
        that, <i>in quam tendem definimus, quatenus Animalia omnia simul ac nata 
        sunt, sponte ipsa natura et citra ullum ratiocinium ipsam complectantur 
        et dolorem refugiant</i>.&nbsp; Let us but listen to Torquatus in Cicero.&nbsp; 
        “Epicurus,” he says, “teaches that every animal as soon as it is born, 
        desires pleasure as its chief good, and delights in the enjoyment of it, 
        but hates pain, as its greatest evil; it shuns it, and avoids it as much 
        as it is able; this it practices while it is not corrupted, when nature 
        judges correctly and without mistake.”&nbsp; There is no need for analysis 
        and argument in these cases, or to look for causes of why pleasure is 
        desirable, and pain to be avoided; we ourselves can easily judge this 
        matter, as we can that fire is hot, snow is white, and honey is sweet.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Maximus of Tyre teaches the same 
        doctrine.&nbsp; “Pleasure,” he says, “more ancient than reason or art, goes 
        before experience, and stays not for much time.&nbsp; But that violent desire 
        we have for it, and which is coexistent with our bodies, is as the 
        foundation of the creature’s well-being, so that if we renounce it, all 
        that shall be born must immediately perish.&nbsp; Man after he comes to 
        years, may by experience and industry, arrive to a competent degree of 
        knowledge, reason, and understanding, (which is so much extolled) 
        naturally and of his own accord; but from his infancy he loves pleasure, 
        and avoids pain, without any help or instruction, for it is pleasure 
        that delights him, and pain that annoys him.”&nbsp; If pleasure were a thing 
        of no value, we should not bring it so early into the world with us, nor 
        would it be the first thing necessary for our preservation.&nbsp; Though from 
        what we have said here, this is not quite enough to conclude that 
        pleasure is man’s chief good or happiness, like Eudoxius does in 
        Aristotle, “in all things, that which is desired, is good, so that which 
        is chiefly desired, ought be the chief good, or that which everything 
        desires, is chiefly desirable; therefore what everything desires, must 
        be the chief good; but that is pleasure; therefore pleasure is that 
        chief good.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Let us now admire the wisdom and 
        foresight of the great creator and author of nature, that insofar as our 
        actions and behaviors are of themselves painful and troublesome, and 
        these also, as Aristotle terms them, being natural, as seeing, hearing, 
        etc, he has caused them all to be sweetened with pleasure.&nbsp; The more 
        necessary these behaviors are for the preservation of our species, the 
        greater pleasure nature has allotted them; otherwise all creatures would 
        neglect or forget not only the act of generation, but even eating and 
        drinking itself, if there were not certain natural instigations that 
        stir and move us, and by causing some kind of pain and uneasiness, mind 
        us of the action, which the pleasure that ought to appease this pain and 
        uneasiness, does promote and encourage, which is a manifest proof, that 
        these sorts of pleasures are not of themselves evil, though men abuse 
        them afterwards by intemperance, contrary to other animals.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">It is not necessary to go on any 
        further, as one does not take the term <i>pleasure</i> to mean sordid 
        and debauched pleasures, extravagance, vanity, the delicacies of the 
        table, dance, women – in a word, those things which the sophists, as 
        Maximus observes, usually object to (styling them <i>Sardanapali 
        scilicet Luxus, Medica mollities, Ionicae deliciae, Siculae mensae, 
        Sybariticae saltationes, Cornithiae meretrices, etc.</i>), but generally 
        all that one can, and usually does, call joy, pleasure, contentment, 
        satisfaction, delectation, comfort, gaiety, peacefulness, quietude, 
        serenity, security, ataraxy, painlessness, tranquility, etc. – which are 
        nothing else than synonyms of pleasure.&nbsp; It is only necessary to 
        remember what we already noted to be one of Aristotle’s doctrines: that 
        whatever we choose is always accompanied by pleasure.&nbsp; And seeing that 
        there are three kinds of goods according to the convention – the honest, 
        the practical, and the pleasant – the pleasant has something in common 
        with the rest, in that the honest and the practical also seem to be 
        pleasant.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Hence we may infer that <i>good</i> 
        and <i>pleasant</i> are synonyms, and that the good is good in itself, 
        and it is an end in itself, so that all things that desire it do so 
        because it is pleasant.&nbsp; It is thereby indubitable that a good which is 
        pleasant is desired for the pleasure it affords.&nbsp; It only remains to be 
        proven that the <i>honest goods</i> and the <i>practical goods</i> also 
        will be desired for pleasure.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>&nbsp;<a name="3.6"></a><br>
        That practical goods are sought for the sake of pleasure</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Now it is not extremely difficult 
        to show that a practical good depends on a pleasant good, i.e., the 
        pleasure which we receive from it.&nbsp; Since it is obvious that one desires 
        a practical good not for the sake of practicality, but as the means to 
        something else, i.e., pleasure itself, or something relating to 
        pleasure.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">To begin with, eating, drinking, 
        song, perfumes, and other similar things obviously relate directly to 
        pleasure.&nbsp; It may similarly be understood that various skills, like the 
        art of cooking, hunting, painting, medicine, and surgery, all serve to 
        deliver us from nuisances from which it is comfortable to be free. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The same goes for navigation, 
        merchandise, and warfare – all which tend towards monetary profit, or 
        something equivalent, by which one can obtain some pleasure that one 
        expects.&nbsp; In effect, when somebody works industriously to earn enough 
        money to buy a house, clothes, medications, books, and other such 
        conveniences, isn't it true that he is expecting pleasure, which he will 
        enjoy when he has enough to retire, without any further pains or trouble 
        – to eat when he is hungry, to drink when he is thirsty, to warm himself 
        when he is cold, to study and to satisfy his curiosity when we he 
        desires to do so – in sum: when he sees himself in a position to pass 
        his life comfortably, securely, honestly, honorably?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This is the general goal of

        <b>That honest goods are sought for the sake of pleasure</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">It would seem a little more 
        difficult to prove that a <i>bonum honestum</i>, or “honest good” 
        depends on pleasure, because this type of good is supposed to be 
        desirable solely and precisely for its own sake, and not as the means to 
        something else.&nbsp; Cicero, among others, appears extremely agitated 
        towards Epicurus for proposing a theory of honesty such as he would have 
        us understand.&nbsp; Cicero replies to Torquatus, “Your Epicurus says that he 
        knows not what they mean – those who value man’s chief happiness only by 
        honesty; those who say that all things are to be referred to that, 
        without pleasure being intermixed with it.&nbsp; These are empty words which 
        he cannot understand nor conceive of what they mean by this word 
        ‘honesty.’ &nbsp;For, so to speak, according to common language, we mean by 
        ‘honest’ that which the people by their general convention term 
        ‘praiseworthy’ and ‘honorable.’&nbsp; And, he says, though it may oftentimes 
        be more pleasing than various other pleasures, still it is desired for 
        pleasure’s sake.&nbsp; See here, he says, this great argument!&nbsp; A famous 
        philosopher, who has made so much clamor in the world and has spread his 
        fame not only over Greece and Italy, but over barbarian lands, says that 
        he does not understands what this ‘honesty’ means that is so often 
        talked about, if there be no pleasure intermixed with it.”&nbsp; In this 
        manner, Cicero juxtaposes the opinion of Epicurus against these 
        remarkable words, that “nothing is deemed honest, but what the general 
        fashion of men recommend.”&nbsp; Aristotle too presents the matter in these 
        terms, <i>&#924;&#951;&#948;&#941;&#957; &#941;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#972; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#957; &#942; &#940;&#949;&#945; &#964;&#972; &#941;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#949;&#957;</i>, “either nothing is 
        honest, or whatever is honest is determined by the opinion of men.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Now, to speak firstly about this 
        concept, or this explanation of honesty, what harm is there if we 
        consider it applicable to men who merit praise and commendation?&nbsp; The 
        word “honest” in Latin is known to derive from the honor that it merits, 
        and among Greeks, <i>&#964;&#972; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#957; </i>does not seem to have any other 
        significance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since if you suppose that it means not only “honest,” 
        but also “beautiful, honorable, laudable, etc.,” you will find that it 
        is not so merely in respect to itself, but in connection to the respect 
        of men which approve it, and allow it to be so.&nbsp; Consequently it should 
        appear “beautiful” and “honorable,” and applicable to whom could be, or 
        must be, lauded.&nbsp; The same ought be understood of the word <i>&#940;&#953;&#967;&#961;&#972;&#957;</i>, 
        which is the opposite of <i>&#954;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#957;</i>; because when we interpret it as 
        “ignoble, unpleasant, or blameworthy and shameful,” we always mean it to 
        relate with men to whom it appears as such.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">For the truth of this, we may rely 
        on Cicero himself, when he postulates that that which is “honest” must 
        be defined insofar as it can as “that which, aside from its 
        practicality, and without any profit, remains commendable in and of 
        itself.” Is it not true, I say, that in the sense which “the honest” is 
        that which is laudible, it exhibits a relationship with those who praise 
        it, or, as Epicurus puts it, “with the common voice of the people” ?&nbsp; As 
        for the rest, who would dare say that Epicurus, in using the word 
        “people,” or “multitude,” meant to exclude the wise, so that it did not 
        apply to the entire population of a city or nation?&nbsp; That would be a 
        ridiculous and tritely mocking remark.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Now, in regard to what Cicero says 
        about no practicality being perceived, Epicurus will agree that honest 
        people expect no profit nor advantage, such as money or some other thing 
        of that kind – but not that they do not expect no benefit whatsoever, 
        such as praise, glory, honor, fame, approval, etc., to which Cicero 
        himself accedes.&nbsp; Since supposing that there are several rewards 
        available to good people, he expressly ensures in his oration of Milo 
        “that among all the rewards of virtue, glory is most bountiful;” and in 
        another place, “that virtue does not require any reward.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt" align="justify">Epicurus 
        therefore seems to have given a good description of what is honest: that 
        which is glorious and honorable, by the convention and universal consent 
        of all mankind.&nbsp; For if at any time a glorious and sensible thing is 
        considered to be sordid or dishonest, this thing truly can well be taken 
        as dishonest by other people, men, or nations which have other laws, and 
        other customs according to notions of “honest” and “dishonest” that are 
        different, but not with regard to the same people who can accordingly be 
        held and supposed honest with its law and with its customs.&nbsp; Thus, 
        Cicero himself sometimes gives this general description of honor: a 
        reward of virtue which is made to somebody by the judgment of his fellow 
        citizens <i>(praemium virtutis judicio studioq; civium delatum ad 
        aliquem)</i>; as if he should say that honor, and consequently, honesty, 
        or what is glorious and honorable by reputation, depends on the judgment 
        of citizens, or the people who make use of their own laws and customs.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt" align="justify">But in 
        conclusion, to say something significant in regard to how what is honest 
        refers back to pleasure, it should be observed that this relation to 
        pleasure does not prevent honesty from being known, in some sense, to be 
        desired from itself, or for its own sake.&nbsp; For it is desired, <i>nulla 
        continugente sive superveniente re,</i> as Aristotle teaches, i.e., 
        according to Cicero: “any foreseeable practicality being without any 
        reward, any fruit which is such as we said to be money, or some other 
        thing of the kind.”&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt" align="justify">For some 
        may desire honor, wisdom, virtue, not to gain profit, or to thereby grow 
        richer from it, but for the honor which is afforded, for garnering 
        understanding and wisdom, for becoming moderate in his passions; all the 
        same because it is pleasant to be honored, wise, virtuous, and to have a 
        serene spirit, and to be at peace.</p>

        <b>Whether the desire for honor is shameful</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt" align="justify">We should 
        observe that while it is indeed despicable to seek honor avariciously or 
        with effrontery, or by a pretended, fake virtue, nevertheless it does 
        not seem that one must condemn the desire for it altogether, as some 
        suppose, but mainly that one should seek it only with pure intentions, 
        and in proper moderation.&nbsp; It is certainly not without reason that this 
        desire be taken as natural.&nbsp; For we recognize that it naturally holds 
        sway among children and among brutes, and that there is nobody who, 
        although he makes a pretence to have an aversion to it, does not 
        recognize that he always likes it, and that he cannot help but desire 
        it, or escape this infatuation.&nbsp; It is not without reason there is such 
        a high regard for it, since one usually expects it as the prize of 
        virtue, and that there is no republic nor state which does not inspire 
        its citizens to great actions by this expectation.&nbsp; There is also this 
        difference between a noble and high soul versus a base and mean soul: 
        that whereas the latter seeks only gain and profit in his efforts, the 
        former only seeks recognition.&nbsp; Moreover, experience teaches us from 
        time immemorial, that if one removes the desire for honor and glory from 
        the public imagination, there would never be any mention made of those 
        grand and wonderful exploits which sustain nations.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt" align="justify">The first 
        sort of pleasure that inspires men to pursue honor is the extreme joy 
        that somebody hopes to experience when his fame spreads among men, so 
        that he will become celebrated in the world.&nbsp; The story of Damocles is 
        well known, as was his expectations to feel a joy beyond words for the 
        royal honor that was bestowed upon him.&nbsp; They know about Demosthenes; 
        this great man slyly admits that he was pleased to hear a common woman, 
        while returning from the fountain, whispering to her companion, “there 
        is Demosthenes,” pointing her finger at him.&nbsp; And we may, without 
        depreciating virtue, believe likewise that other illustrious men, during 
        their walks, hear themselves named.&nbsp; The people say about them in 
        public, “There is Chappelle, the finest wit of the kingdom!&nbsp; Here is 
        Despréaux, the Horace of our age, the everlasting speaker of truths!&nbsp; 
        There is the famous Racine, who by the charming efficacy of his verses, 
        knows, when he pleases, how to make us weep!&nbsp; Here is the learned and 
        unrivaled Lady Sabliere!”&nbsp; How pleasant it is to be so taken notice of 
        in the world for some perfection, and pointed out by eminent persons!&nbsp;
        <i>At pluchrum est digito monstrari et dicier hic est.&nbsp; </i>It is also 
        known what is reported about Themistocles, that after a notable victory 
        he observed what he had gained: that everyone, neglecting to watch the 
        public combats, had their eyes fixed upon him, so that he said with 
        ecstatic joy to his friends, “I gain on this day a full reward for all 
        the toil that I have suffered for Greece.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt" align="justify">The other 
        kind of pleasure which motivates men to desire honor is the enjoyment of 
        security, more especially because he who lives wholly in perfect 
        security finds himself empowered to do what seems to him to be good, and 
        to enjoy the pleasures he likes, with nobody in the way.&nbsp; We easily 
        believe that security is obtained by honor, either because honor is 
        bestowed for the sake of virtue, or because of high offices and 
        distinctions which presuppose virtue.&nbsp; If it be for virtue’s sake, it 
        makes sense that he should be free from contempt, and the honored person 
        does not fall into a position where he is exposed to the insults, and 
        affronts.&nbsp; And if it be for the sake of high offices and nobility, and 
        consequently for some advantage to be expected, or for some evil that we 
        dread, then even for this purpose one usually has very strong and firm 
        support.&nbsp; But herein we may find this difference: the honor which is 
        bestowed because of&nbsp; nobility, being more splendid, and impressing the 
        common folk even more, one sees in it a great many who desire nobility 
        and high offices, and very few who aspire for the sake of virtue, so 
        that those who are promoted to nobility can grant favors to some and 
        injure others, they can consequently secure themselves from the power of 
        some by hope, and from the others by fear.</td>

        The benefits of moral virtue</b></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now in dealing with virtue itself, Aristotle and 
        Cicero declare wonders about the delights and pleasures of knowledge and 
        learning, which make up the first part of moral virtue.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“Nature,” says Aristotle, “the mother of all, stirs 
        up and gives unspeakable pleasures to he who can attain an understanding 
        of the causes of things, and study philosophy truly and with purpose. If 
        we cannot without delight look upon the bare images of nature, it is 
        because in casting our eyes upon them, we behold the ingenuity and skill 
        of the painter or the engraver who made them; how much more the 
        contemplation of nature itself, and of her admirable wisdom and 
        contrivances, ought to fill our minds with joy and satisfaction?”</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cicero also speaks of it as no less beneficial. “The 
        consideration,” he says, “and contemplation of nature, is the true and 
        natural food of the soul. It is that which lifts and inspires our 
        thoughts; for when we think upon celestial bodies, which are so great, 
        large, and of such a vast extent, we scoff at what is here below, as 
        lowly and insignificant.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seneca’s words are no less remarkable: “Oh! How 
        contemptible is man,” he says, “if he does not look beyond the mundane! 
        We may say that then the spirit of man has attained its greatest 
        happiness that its nature is capable of, when it has trampled down all 
        vice, raising itself to sublime matters, and ponders the secrets of 
        nature. It’s then, while walking among the celestial orbs, it disdains 
        the green fields, and all the gold that the earth produces for our 
        covetous posterity. There are above us, spacious heavens, which our 
        souls take then possession of. When it has there arrived, it is 
        nourished and grows, and being freed from its earthly prison, it returns 
        to its first essence; for, it is a certain sign of its being of a divine 
        nature, that divine objects are pleasing to it, which it looks upon not 
        as belonging to others, but as its own.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here is the place to make mention of the pleasures 
        and transports of joy and of mathematics. Plutarch relates, “that 
        Eudoxius would have been willing to have been burnt as Phaeton was, if 
        he could first have been admitted to approach so near the sun, that he 
        could closely inspect its shape, greatness, and beauty. </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same author tells us that Pythagoras was so 
        ravished with joy when he had found that famous theorem (which is the 
        forty-seventh in Euclid’s first book), that he immediately made a solemn 
        sacrifice. </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also says, about Archimedes, that on many 
        occasions one was obliged to forcefully withdraw him from his deep 
        meditations. So much did they fill him with pleasure, that he felt he 
        was dying of joy when he had found how much brass might be mixed in the 
        gold crown that the king had consecrated to the gods, he exited the bath 
        transported with joy, and decried, “I have found it, I have found it!”
        <i>&#917;&#944;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;, &#917;&#944;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;!</i></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“There is nothing,” says Cicero, “more pleasant than 
        the sweet contemplation of a wise old age. We see Gallus, your father’s 
        friend, dying in joy, while speculating about the stars, and measuring 
        the heavens and the earth. How many times has he surprised him from 
        morning, until the evening, when he had undertaken to describe something 
        of the stars? And how many a night has he found him in the evening, when 
        he had begun from the morning? Oh what pleasure did he take to foretell 
        the eclipses of the sun and moon!</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In regards to the other liberal arts, it is known 
        what pleasures offer the knowledge of history, antiquity, the beauty of 
        poetry, and the grace of rhetoric. These studies were known to Cicero as 
        “a pleasant entertainment for youth, a pastime in old age, an ornament 
        in times of prosperity, and a sweet refuge in times of adversity.” <i>
        Haec studia adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant, fecundas res 
        ornant, adversis perfugium &amp; flotatium praebent; delectant domi, non 
        impudiunt foris, pernoctant nobifcum, peregrinator, rufticantur. </i>
        They give us pleasure at home, and do not disappoint us in the country, 
        they sleep with us, they accompany us on our voyages, and are splendid 
        in the fields with us; where are the pleasures of the banquets, of 
        plays, and of women that can be compared with such sweet pleasures? Men 
        freely spend whole days and nights in pursuit of learning, and think no 
        pains too great to be bestowed in obtaining it; so great and exquisite 
        is the pleasure thereof, when acquired. <i>Omnia prepetiuntur ipsa 
        cognitione &amp; scientia capti, &amp; cum maximis curis, &amp; laboribus compensant 
        eam quam ex discendo capiunt voluptatem.</i></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the other part of virtue, which is 
        specifically known as <i>moral virtue,</i> we will be obliged to speak 
        about it more at length when we discuss its four most celebrated 
        manifestations: <i>prudence, fortitude, temperance, </i>and <i>justice.
        </i></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, supposing that it’s an undeniable truth that 
        there is nothing sweeter than to live life without reproach, without 
        falling victim to crime, to live wisely and according to the principles 
        of honesty, without failing the duties of the life, to do nobody wrong, 
        to be good with everyone as much as it is possible. Supposing, I say, 
        that these kinds of maxims are true, which we will also touch upon later 
        on, I hereby make a few observations.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, that it is not without reason that, from time 
        immemorial, one compares virtue with a plant whose root is bitter, but 
        whose fruits are very sweet, and that Plato, Xenophon, and several 
        others highly commended those verses of Hesiod which affirm that virtue 
        is acquired only by sweat and toil, and that the way to it is truly long 
        and difficult, and tough going in the beginning – but that when one 
        arrived at the top, there is nothing sweeter and more pleasant.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The gods through sweat and pains to virtue lead,<br>
          But long and arduous is the path we tread;<br>
          Rugged and steep when first you venture on,<br>
          But at the top arrived, with easy speed you run.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unto which one might add this saying of Epicharmus: 
        that the gods sell all good things to us by payment of our pains and 
        travails.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>Labore nobis cuncta,<br>
          Dii vendunt bona.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This shows us that it is necessary to readily endure 
        the labors of acquiring virtue, as they must be followed by marvelous 
        pleasure and comfort. It is not without reason that so much is spoken 
        about the crossroads where pleasure and virtue so eloquently harangued 
        Hercules, each one trying to attract him to their different paths. For 
        this confirms the truth of those principles that we spoke about earlier, 
        when we said that it is necessary to flee those pleasures which are 
        followed by greater displeasures, just as it is necessary to embrace the 
        hardships and toil which bring greater goods, and greater pleasures. 
        Though it is supposed, I know, that Hercules rejects pleasure, i.e., a 
        soft and indolent life, and that he followed virtue, i.e., a hard life, 
        being full of difficulties, Maximus of Tyre has this to say: “When he 
        was at his most extreme labors, he felt, or had in view, marvelous 
        pleasures. You see Hercules’ extraordinary labors, but you do not see 
        the incredible pleasures that either attend or follow them.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whosoever takes away pleasure from virtue, takes from 
        it all strength and efficacy; for were it not for pleasure, men would 
        never undertake any great matter. He who, out of zeal for virtue, 
        willingly undergoes any trouble, this is purely for the sake of some 
        pleasure he feels or expects. For like hoarding up some treasure, no man 
        will prefer a pebble over a ruby, nor brass over gold, unless he is 
        utterly destitute of all reason and understanding. So with respect to 
        labor and trouble, no man labors merely and purely for labor’s sake; 
        this would turn to a very sorry account; but we willingly exchange the 
        present labors for virtue; that is, in plain English, as the Stoics term 
        it, for <i>pleasure;</i> for he who speaks of virtue, speaks of delight. 
        Virtue itself would be much neglected if at the same time it were not 
        attended with delight. For my part, I must declare, that I run quite 
        counter to commonly held beliefs, for I look upon pleasure to be the 
        most beautiful, the most desirable thing in the world, and that which we 
        ought most directly to pursue; and it is for its sake, I believe, that 
        men so frequently expose themselves to all hazards and dangers, and even 
        confront death itself. We are apt to give various names to the cause 
        that first motivates us to undertake such great deeds; for instance, 
        that which motivated Achilles to die voluntarily for Patrocles, we call
        <i>friendship;</i> that which inclined Agamemnon to enter into and carry 
        on a war with so much diligence and fatigue, was the <i>care</i> of 
        preserving his kingdom; that of Hector’s recurrent campaigning to defeat 
        his enemies, was the <i>desire</i> to preserve his country. Yet, all 
        these several terms are just other names for pleasures. Just as with the 
        distempers of the body, the patient desiring health, not only freely 
        submits himself to hunger and thirst, but also willingly undergoes the 
        most virulent pains and torments of surgeons’ instruments; but if it 
        were not for this hope, he would never endure such tortures. So in the 
        actions of life, there is a compensation for the troubles that we 
        undergo with pleasure, which you truly term <i>virtue,</i> and which I 
        allow so. But at the same time I ask, does your mind embrace virtue, 
        without any love for it? And if you concede this (that you have such a 
        love) ought you not to agree also that you have a pleasure in it? Modify 
        the words as much as you please, call it neither
        <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">“</span>pleasure” 
        nor <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">“</span>delight,” 
        but <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">“</span>joy” 
        or <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">“</span>satisfaction” 
        – I shall not quibble about names; I am only concerned about the thing 
        itself, and I find that pleasure, or satisfaction, inspired Hercules to 
        action.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second comment I shall make is that philosophers 
        themselves seem to have declared war on pleasure while elevating virtue. 
        Being men of eminence, they differ from Epicurus more in word than in 
        deed.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I might here mention something about their manners, 
        as Lucian does, when he proclaims so aptly that if they had the ring of 
        Gyges, or the helmet of Pluto, so that they could become invisible to 
        all persons, they would soon give up on their sacred pains, their work, 
        and their inconveniences, and pursue the pleasures and delights which 
        they appear to condemn. Less flatteringly, Maximus of Tyre quips that 
        they are like Aesop’s Shepard, who when questioned by a lion if he had 
        seen the stag that it was pursuing, he answered “no,” indicating with 
        his finger the place where it went; i.e., if these virtuous pretenders 
        give up pleasure, it is only in word and in appearance. But leaving 
        aside their manners, which by no means correspond what they preach, it 
        is sufficient to know that Epicurus too, as they admit, holds virtue 
        supreme, and when they get incensed when he proclaims that virtue is 
        just a very effective means of arriving at the <i>final end</i> or the
        <i>chief good,</i> instead of affirming, as they do, that virtue itself 
        is the final end, or the chief good, even, they fundamentally say just 
        the same thing as he does, only in different terms.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Truly, this is precisely what they say. Moreover, 
        their celebrated maxim is that “virtue alone is enough to make us 
        happy,” or, as Cicero puts it, “to live happily, we need only be 
        virtuous.” Now, if we rightly understand this same maxim, must we 
        thereby recognize that virtue is <i>not</i> the chief good, but rather a
        <i>means</i> that contributes towards obtaining happiness? Is it not 
        sufficient in itself, without needing any other sort of means? 
        Consequently, might we only conclude that the happy life, or happiness, 
        which is obtained by the means of virtue, is the chief good and the 
        final end, because this good, or this end in itself, is not to the means 
        to something else? To live happily – can this be anything else than 
        living delightfully, comfortably, with pleasantness, or, to include that 
        key synonym which shocks them so tremendously, <i>with pleasure?</i></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certainly, the Stoics were less astute about it than 
        Aristotle, who held that “pleasure is mixed into happiness,” and that 
        “by pleasure, the contemplation or operation of happiness is increased.” 
        Nevertheless, I do not doubt that if the happy life could be construed, 
        or could indeed be without sweetness and pleasure, they would render it 
        entirely desolate, and that while climbing their difficult mountain of 
        the virtue, they undoubtedly would not suffer so many difficulties, if 
        they did not proclaim that the summit abounded with sweetness.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Socrates himself, whose resolution and courage they 
        covet – has he not plainly described happiness to be a pleasure which is 
        not alloyed with repentance? And Antisthenes, the father of the Cynics 
        and the author of that famous maxim of the Stoics that says “he would 
        rather become an idiot than seek pleasure” – does he not yield to this 
        in the writings of Stobeus? That being, “we ought not to seek those 
        pleasures which come before our labors and difficulties, but those that 
        follow.” <i>Venandas esse eas voluptates, non quae labores aut molestias 
        praecedunt, sed quae consequuntur. </i></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But to demonstrate even more clearly how pleasure 
        accompanies even the Cynical lifestyle, which the Stoics deem truly 
        austere, yet happy, Maximus of Tyre should be heard once again, who, in 
        speaking of Diogenes, has described it better than anyone. “What,” he 
        says, “inspired Diogenes to retire to his tub? Was it not pleasure? For 
        though it was also virtue that made him abide there, why must we 
        separate his pleasure from his reasoning? Diogenes was just as pleased 
        in his tub as Xerxes was in the City of Babylon, and in feeding upon his 
        boiled barley and dried bread, as Smyndrides upon his dainty Dishes and 
        exquisite fare. He was well satisfied in the sun, as Sardanapalus was in 
        purple garments with his staff in his hand, as Alexander with his lance 
        and with his satchel on his back, as Croesus in the midst of his 
        treasures. And if you please to compare the pleasures of the one with 
        those of the others, you shall find the pleasures of Diogenes to be 
        preferred, because pain and trouble have always come from every corner 
        to disturb the pleasures of those men who seemed to be happy. When 
        Xerxes was overcome, he wept; Cambyses being wounded, fell into sorrow; 
        Sardanapalus groaned in the flames. When Smyndrides was banished, he was 
        troubled. When Croesus was prisoner, he shed tears. Alexander, being 
        stopped in his wars, complained. But the pleasures of Diogenes were free 
        from complaints, cries, tears, and displeasure. You may call labors and 
        troublesome actions as types of pleasures, if you should put yourself in 
        Diogenes’ place. But this is not fair, for if you were to do what he 
        did, you might lament what Diogenes made his pleasure. And yet I dare 
        affirm that never any man had a more earnest desire for pleasure than 
        Diogenes had. He had no house; the care of a family is troublesome. He 
        was never concerned in the government; it is an employment full of 
        sorrows. He shunned matrimony, for he had known the infamous example of 
        Xanthippe. He never brought up children; he understood well the 
        difficulties. But having banished from himself all sorrow, being 
        altogether free, without care, fear, or grief – he alone among men 
        enjoyed all the earth as a single and common house, fully possessing the 
        pleasures which cannot be circumscribed, and which are free and open to 
        the entire world, and which are to be found plentifully in every place.
        <i>Verum depulsa omni molestia, plenus libertate, expers solicitudinis, 
        absque metu, citra dolorem habebat unus hominum universam rerum quasi 
        unam domum, voluptatibus passim fruens incustoditis, patentibus, 
        copiosis.</i></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third observation is that those who seem to 
        glorify themselves, or who in effect boast of acting out of pure love 
        for virtue without any regard to themselves or to their pleasure, 
        nevertheless do all that they do for the sake of pleasure. Those who 
        expose themselves to many dangers for the sake of a friend, or the 
        safety of their country, and who even face certain death, do not do so 
        having in mind a pleasure to be experienced after death – they do it for 
        the pleasure of the present which enraptures them, and which animates 
        them, when they think that what they will do will give freedom to their 
        father and mother, their children, their friends, and other citizens, or 
        that it will bring about some great benefit, when they are pondering how 
        dear their memory will be to their descendants, and all of posterity; 
        when they foresee trophies, statues, and the honors which they will not 
        miss; when they consider that this moment of bad times, which remains to 
        be endured, will be transformed into an immortal glory; they do it, I 
        say, for the present pleasure which overjoys them, which inspires them, 
        and which animates them.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is understood by he who ventures towards certain 
        death, because there is still hope to escape from it. One need only 
        refer to the story that Torquatus tells about one of his ancestors. “It 
        is true,” he says, “that he tore the necklace from the clutches of his 
        enemy, but to save himself from being killed. He ran a great risk, but 
        it was before the eyes of the whole army. What did he get from it? Honor 
        and esteem – the strongest guarantees of security in life.” Likewise, 
        Seneca says, “Upon the performance of any great and glorious action, 
        there immediately arises an extraordinary joy and delight; we reap no 
        advantage after death, yet the very thoughts of the action that we are 
        about to commit please us; for when a generous man ponders the reward of 
        his death, namely, the liberty of his country, the deliverance of those 
        for whom he sacrifices his life, he attains a great deal of pleasure, 
        and enjoys the rewards of running the risk. And he who feels that joy, 
        which happens at the last moment of the action, runs on to death without 
        any demur – content and satisfied in the goodness, piety, and holiness 
        of the action.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same must say those severe fathers who have 
        punished their own children with death. Although they seem to deprive 
        themselves of great pleasures (an objection which Cicero repeatedly 
        raises to Torquatus as well) who by dealing a blow of the axe to their 
        sons, prefers the right of the empire to nature, and to paternal love, 
        because those who come to such extremes know that the nature of their 
        children is such that it is either better for them, or for their 
        children themselves, that they die rather than live; because they would 
        only live in perpetual displeasure, and that their eternal infamy would 
        haunt them. Therefore, since they believe that it is better, they also 
        believe that it is more agreeable to avert the aggravation of an 
        infamous future by a present pain, and to purge, so to speak, that which 
        was done in disgrace by some great and illustrious action, rather than 
        to sink themselves into an abyss of misfortune. Take notice also of how 
        the same Torquatus responds: “He sentenced his own son to death—if from 
        no motive, then I am sorry to be the descendant of anyone so savage and 
        inhuman; but if his purpose was, by inflicting pain upon himself, to 
        establish his authority as a commander and to tighten the reins of 
        discipline during a very serious war by holding over his army the fear 
        of punishment, then his action aimed at ensuring the safety of his 
        fellow citizens, upon which he knew his own depended.”</p>

        On self-love</b></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What generally applies to virtue can also be said of 
        piety towards God, since it seems that there cannot be sincere piety if 
        God is not purely and properly loved for himself, or because he is 
        infinitely good, and if he is not loved and worshipped because he is 
        infinitely excellent. So he who worships – does he not look after 
        himself at all, or consider his rewards, or his pleasure? For my part, 
        God forbid that I intend to depreciate the piety of anyone. For there 
        are some who not only argue that it is necessary to love God in this 
        way, and who not only believe, therefore, that it is possible, but in 
        sanctioning the doctrine, and countering the objection, they assert and 
        believe that they do. Assuredly, I don’t envy them, nor shall I 
        contradict them. Far from it, I approve and revere their happiness and 
        their grace, and particularly that Heaven rewards them; for it should be 
        believed that it is a divine and extraordinary gift that a man can 
        prevail upon himself to love and worship God in this manner.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But here we are discussing piety, and generally about 
        the virtue arising from nature, in which man does all that he does with 
        some self-regard. Might it not be said that God, in such a manner, is 
        accustomed to the infirmity of our nature? Having scarcely any passage 
        in the Holy Scriptures which authorizes and expresses their doctrine, 
        are not there yet a great many of those who approve of loving God 
        greatly, because he forgave them for their many sins or because he has 
        graced them with so many favors? Are there not those who love him for 
        the hope promised to them in Heaven, who perform various acts of 
        charity, suffering persecution, keeping the faith, etc., because of the 
        kingdom prepared for them since the creation of the world, for the 
        abundant rewards which wait for them in Heaven, for the crown of justice 
        that God promised to those who love him? Would one dare, I say, to 
        entertain this notion, and to infer from all these passages that nothing 
        hinders those who do not have in view these everlasting delights which 
        must one day come to those who have loved God, and who have worshipped 
        him?</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly would not provoke anyone’s conscience, 
        nor dare I ask what would they do if, after God had been worshipped and 
        loved, he took no care of those who had loved and worshipped him, and 
        if, in such a case, he neither granted them any reward, nor gave them 
        any hopes of anything to be expected in all eternity. I dare not ask 
        them, for my part, what they would do, or whether they would love or 
        worship him less. I only want them to consider this proposition: if they 
        love and worship him because it is very pleasant to love and serve him 
        in this manner, and if they therefore believe that it is very pleasant 
        and very grateful to be thus disposed towards God, purely and absolutely 
        for his sake, and without any regard for themselves. Since he who tells 
        us that “his yoke is easy,” to inspire us to love him with all our 
        heart, with all our soul, with all our understanding, and all our 
        strength – certainly he did not neglect this sweetness and pleasure.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But here it should be said in passing that all of 
        this strengthens and confirms the reason by which one proves, according 
        to the opinion of Epicurus, that pleasure is the chief good, or the 
        final end, being desired for itself, so that all other things are 
        desirable for its sake. Now let us review another reason, which is 
        derived from a comparison between pleasure and pain (which is its 
        opposite). Torquatus speaks thus,</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us imagine a man living in the continuous 
          enjoyment of numerous and vivid pleasures alike of body and of mind, 
          undisturbed either by the presence or by the prospect of pain: what 
          possible state of existence could we describe as being more excellent 
          or more desirable? One so situated must possess in the first place a 
          strength of mind that is proof against all fear of death or of pain; 
          he will know that death means complete unconsciousness, and that pain 
          is generally light if long and short if strong, so that its intensity 
          is compensated by brief duration and its continuance by diminishing 
          severity. Let such a man moreover have no dread of any supernatural 
          power; let him never suffer the pleasures of the past to fade away, 
          but constantly renew their enjoyment in recollection—and his lot will 
          be one which will not admit of further improvement. Suppose on the 
          other hand a person crushed beneath the heaviest load of mental and of 
          bodily anguish to which humanity is liable. Grant him no hope of 
          ultimate relief in view; also give him no pleasure either present or 
          in prospect. Can one describe or imagine a more pitiable state? If 
          then, a life full of pain is the thing most to be avoided, it follows 
          that to live in pain is the highest evil; and this position implies 
          that a life of pleasure ultimate good. In fact the mind possesses 
          nothing in itself upon which it can rest as final. Every fear, every 
          sorrow can be traced back to pain; there is not other thing besides 
          pain which is of its own nature capable of causing either anxiety or 
          distress.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To which Cicero later counters,</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not venture to say whom – virtue herself shall 
          speak for me, and she will not hesitate to rank Marcus Regulus higher 
          than this typically happy man, as you would call him. Regulus, of his 
          own free will and under no compulsion except that of a promise given 
          to an enemy, returned from his native land to Carthage; yet virtue 
          proclaims that when he had done so, he was happier while tormented 
          with sleeplessness and hunger than Thorius carousing on his couch of 
          roses. Regulus had fought great wars, had twice been consul, had 
          celebrated a triumph; yet all his earlier exploits he counted less 
          great and glorious than that final disaster, which he chose to undergo 
          for the sake of honor and of self-respect; a pitiable end, as it seems 
          to us who hear of it, but full of pleasure for him who endured it. It 
          is not merriment and wantonness, nor laughter or jesting, the comrade 
          of frivolity, that make men happy; those are happy, often in sadness, 
          whose wills are strong and true.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><a name="4.3"></a><br>
        On the false virtue and the false happiness of Regulus</b></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now let us note something about these compared 
        examples before we return to the eloquence of Cicero. Although one 
        should not even slightly endorse Thorius and his overly decadent 
        lifestyle, which Epicurus would never approve of, it nevertheless seems 
        quite difficult to conceive that Regulus was indeed happier than 
        Thorius. Actually, I perceive a great showiness and pompous rhetoric, 
        which follows a tradition of exaggerating the much-praised virtue of 
        Regulus. However, by examining his story with objectivity, and to 
        carefully consider the full range of circumstances, things are not what 
        they seem.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Polybius informs us that Regulus, having commanded 
        auspiciously in the war against the Carthaginians and concerned that 
        another consul, he would be sent from Rome to replace him, should steal 
        away the honor of his brave exploits, he negotiated with the 
        Carthaginians for peace. But the conditions that he proposed to their 
        deputies were so harsh, that they preferred to risk everything. Choosing 
        for their general Xanthippus the Lacedaemonian, they confronted Regulus 
        in a battle, won the victory, and took him prisoner with five hundred 
        others with whom he was fleeing. “An undoubted indication,” says the 
        same Polybius, “of the fickleness of Fortune, and of the little trust we 
        should put in her flattering smiles, seeing that he, who but a little 
        before, could not be moved to pity, and had no compassion of the 
        afflicted, was soon after obliged to cast himself at their feet and to 
        beg for his life.” Polyaenus adds further that Regulus swore to the 
        Carthaginians that if they would allow him to depart, he would persuade 
        the Romans to make peace with them, and if he could not do so, he would 
        return back to Carthage. But he advised the Senate to the contrary, 
        discovering the weakness of the enemy, the means whereby they might 
        destroy them; and that their Carthaginian prisoners were young and stout 
        captains, whereas he was decrepit and old. “This he whispered,” says 
        Appian, “to the chief of the Romans.” Cicero says “His opinion so much 
        prevailed, that they kept back the prisoners; there was no peace made, 
        and he retuned to Carthage.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is true that his departure was done in a strange 
        manner; because Horace says that while leaving he fixed his gaze upon 
        the ground like a criminal, and that he callously put aside his wife, 
        and their small children who cried for him, not permitting them to even 
        embrace him for the last time.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His wife’s chaste kiss, his prattling boys,<br>
          The former partners of his joys;<br>
          Now grown a slave, thrown down by fate,<br>
          And lessened from his former state;<br>
          He shunned with manly modesty,<br>
          And on the Earth he cast his stubborn eye;<br>
          While thus by strange advice, he sought<br>
          And fixed the wavering Senate’s vote.<br>
          Then through his weeping friends he ran<br>

          And did from business and cares retreat,<br>
          To the cool pleasures of a country seat.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, we must observe what Tuditanus relates, 
        that when he advised them to make no exchange of the prisoners, he 
        informed them that the Carthaginians had given him a slow poison, such 
        that he could only live until the exchange was made, afterwards he was 
        to waste away and die.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We may also take notice of that which is to be found 
        among the fragments of Diodorus Siculus. “Now, who will not disapprove 
        of the pride and vanity of Attilus Regulus, who, not being able to 
        support himself under such great prosperity, which seemed to him like a 
        heavy burden, deprived himself of the reward of general applause, and 
        brought his own country into eminent danger? For when he might have 
        concluded an honorable and advantageous peace to the people of Rome, and 
        obtained the glory of a remarkable clemency and renown, he arrogantly 
        insulted the afflicted, and required such harsh and unreasonable terms 
        of peace, that he not only drew upon himself God’s displeasure, but 
        stimulated the conquered to such an implacable hatred, that he renewed 
        their courage and they ventured to fight afresh. By his fault, the 
        affairs were changed in such a manner that he and his whole army were 
        routed; thirty thousand of them being slain in the field, and fifteen 
        thousand taken prisoner with him, etc.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From this, one must surmise that Regulus figured that 
        he could never repair the blunder he had committed, and that he would 
        henceforth pass his days in Rome with a reputation as an imprudent and 
        arrogant man. He thus preferred to be turned over to Carthage, 
        preferring the peril (which he apparently did not dread too much because 
        of the Carthaginian prisoners who would remain within the hands of the 
        Romans) over an unquestionable infamy and also a life that he foresaw as 
        short and languishing, because of the poison that the Carthaginians had 
        given him.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Be that as it may, when Regulus, not having 
        accomplished anything in Rome, turned himself over to Carthage, and by 
        doing so kept his word, doubtless he cannot be too much esteemed; but 
        when he dissuaded the Senate from what he had promised to persuade them 
        to do, how can that pass as a laudable thing, since it was an obvious 
        perjury? If he had contented himself with the plain delivery of his 
        message, without aiming to persuade or dissuade, that would seem 
        tolerable, but to openly break the sacred laws of oaths, how can that be 
        excused?</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“And when he did it in secret,” as Appian indicates, 
        “in fear that the ambassadors who came with him might catch wind of it – 
        that in itself increases the suspicion and aggravates the crime.” Would 
        you appeal to the pretext of the safety and the glory of the Republic? 
        Indeed it is necessary to help one’s country by good advice, and 
        fortitude, and courage – but not by wicked pretenses and treachery. One 
        must not, in order to be good citizen, fail to be a good man.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would you say, as Euripides would, that he only swore 
        it with his tongue, and not with his heart? (<i>Illum jurasse Lingua, 
        Mentem gessisse injuratam</i>.) But this is only to seek a cover-up for 
        perjury. For, as Cicero puts it, “it is not a perjury to swear falsely, 
        perjury is not performing what the oath signifies, according to the 
        common meaning of words.”</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In effect, if no one had any scruples about meaning 
        one thing while saying another, this would be admitting that it is 
        indeed permissible to lie and to mislead those who listen to our words, 
        or those who question us; this would render us suspicious of everyone, 
        and thus would make a strange confusion in the transaction of human 
        affairs. Will you say that it is allowed, because the Carthaginians had 
        not themselves kept their word as they had given it? But if you were a 
        wicked man, I am not obliged for that reason to be a dishonest man – 
        otherwise, what difference would there be between me and you? One ought 
        to deal with treacherous people with precaution, or by sheer force; but 
        it is not permissible to deal with anyone by distorting one’s word. As 
        the old saying goes, “one should either not make promises, or keep 
        them.” Thus it seems that the Carthaginians inflicted horrible tortures 
        upon him because he acted against the word that he had given to them – 
        he dissuaded the Romans against making peace, and the exchange of the 
        prisoners. Indeed, as Tubero reports, “the noblest Carthaginian 
        prisoners were put into the hands of Regulus’ children, who made them 
        die by the same tortures as Regulus suffered.” But would you please 
        consider, I ask you, did Regulus have a reason to prefer the slaughter 
        of these prisoners to the well-being of the five hundred Roman soldiers 
        who had been taken with him, and for the sake of his “magnificent” 
        virtue, cruelly perished with him in Carthage?</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But to return to our point regarding happiness, I 
        would still eagerly demand that it be explained to me in all seriousness 
        how the happiness of Regulus could be greater than that of Thorius, when 
        Regulus was tormented in a manner that the astute Tubero relates to us. 
        “They kept him a long time,” he says, “in dismal dark dungeons; then 
        they cut off his eyelids, and when the sun shone brightest, they brought 
        him forth and exposed him to the sunbeams, forcing him to hold his eyes 
        in that direction, knowing it was not possible for him to shut them. 
        Cicero informs us that he was bound in a contraption, and that after 
        they had cut off his eyelids, they destroyed him while watching. Seneca 
        describes this device as a tub stuck through with nails, in which he was 
        enclosed. Sylvius presents us with this description:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With threatening rows they armed the sloping wood,<br>
          And torturing nails at equal distance stood.<br>
          Thus robbed of sleep, by never sleeping pain,<br>
          He grows his own tormentor, and in vain<br>
          Flexes his limbs by turning to relieve,<br>
          While only varied wounds the varied postures give.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But you might say that Thorius embraced pleasure with 
        unbecoming delicacy, and that Regulus, for the safety of the Republic, 
        preferred his tortures and to suffer them courageously. First of all, 
        Thorius was neither so unfit, nor so voluptuous; when the safety of the 
        Republic required it, he went to war, and he himself ultimately died 
        with weapons in hand, fighting for the Republic in the battlefield, as 
        Cicero himself indicates.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, although it is a great consolation in the 
        midst of torture to feel a pure and clear conscience, and to see that 
        one suffers for the safety of many, to preserve the honor of dignity, 
        and of honesty, nevertheless it does not seem that one is happier for 
        that – happier than living life honestly, doing wrong to nobody, 
        endeavoring to do good with as many as we can, and fulfilling the duty a 
        good man, and a good citizen, so that one lives his life agreeably, with 
        much pleasure, and little pain or sorrow.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lastly, if somebody was in this frame of mind, that 
        he was entirely ready to expose himself to such danger just described, 
        to suffer all possible toils and to expose his own life and blood 
        without shirking the dignity of his duty, and stable employment, and 
        that he found himself in such a position that he had to choose between 
        the two ways of life that Torquatus illustrates, so that he must pick 
        one or the other of the two without doing wrong by his duty; who could 
        it be, I ask you, among those who so extremely curse pleasure and who so 
        much commend pain – who would suppose that he would opt for the latter, 
        and willingly embrace it?</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the rest, it seems that it would be suitable 
        here to reiterate more keenly, and a little more at length, what was 
        already mentioned before: that pain is the chief evil, since that was 
        the antecedent premise, which by the rule of opposites, it follows that 
        pleasure is the chief good.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the same reason which it was proven that pleasure 
        is the primary good that one naturally follows (<i>primum familiare seu 
        accommodatum</i>), and thus it is the chief good, it was also proven 
        that pain is the primary evil that one naturally flees (<i>primum 
        alienum se incommodans</i>), and thus the chief evil. As nature has 
        imprinted upon all animals a natural love for pleasure, it has at the 
        same time imprinted upon them a natural hatred of pain.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So let us now observe a few things. The first is that 
        by the term “pain” one does not include just what are called the pains 
        of the body, but also those pains which are known as the troubles of the 
        mind, particularly as they are harsher and more aggravating than those 
        of the body, as we explained earlier. Secondly, as it was said that 
        virtue and honesty have within them something to cause great pleasures, 
        likewise one can now say that vice, or that which is scandalous and 
        dishonest, has something within them to cause very great pains. So 
        virtue, or honesty, is accompanied by very great goods, and vice, or 
        what is dishonest and scandalous, is accompanied by very great evils. So 
        among the things that one desires in order to obtain the chief good, 
        virtue is what one must chiefly pursue, and among the things that one 
        must shun in order to escape the chief evil, vice is what one must 
        mainly flee. Lastly, that this belief seems to be entirely compatible 
        with the sacred doctrines of Faith, by which we similarly believe that 
        happiness, or the chief good, consists in the everlasting joy and 
        delights that someday will be experienced in Heaven; and thus we believe 
        that unhappiness, or the chief evil, consists in being someday tormented 
        in Hell by unspeakable pain, and the heat of horrific and eternal fires.</p>

        We have up to this point spoken about pleasure as it is generally 
        understood.&nbsp; It now remains to speak about a special kind of pleasure, 
        known particularly as the kind that the wise devote themselves to. &nbsp;It 
        is very natural, very easy to obtain, very long-lasting, entirely free 
        from misgivings – it is, to put it succinctly, as we have done so 
        before: to have peace of mind, and bodily comfort.&nbsp; It is not without 
        reason that we say it is very natural, because it is this kind of 
        pleasure that Nature seems to ultimately aim for.&nbsp; Other pleasures, 
        which are “in motion,” merely make pleasant those actions which tend 
        towards this goal.&nbsp; For example, Nature instituted the pleasure of 
        taste, rendering the action of eating pleasant, thus inspiring the 
        animal to eat, so that it appeases hunger, which is the pain, or unease, 
        from the pangs of the empty stomach.&nbsp; So this comfortable and calm state 
        which one enjoys when hunger is satisfied – this is what was intended as 
        the ultimate goal, making it the chief or final good.&nbsp; It is not without 
        reason that we say it is very easy to obtain; because everyone has the 
        power to overcome one’s passions to achieve a tranquil spirit, and to 
        obtain the things which are truly necessary for the body, so that he is 
        in comfort. &nbsp;I also claim that it is very long-lasting, because the 
        other kinds of pleasures reside in the moment, and, so to speak, leap 
        away from us, whereas this kind of pleasure endures, never ceasing until 
        it expires – almost always by our undoing.&nbsp; I say finally that it is 
        entirely free from misgivings; since from all the other pleasures it can 
        be seen that some evils follow them, whereas this kind of pleasure is 
        absolutely pure, never causing any damage.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        It is true that Cicero starts out making prolonged arguments against 
        Epicurus for equating “tranquility plus comfort” with the name of 
        “pleasure,” and he pretends to only understand the kind which is in 
        motion, or those kinds which please the senses.&nbsp; Although Cicero did not 
        grasp it, this does not seem to be any kind of argument other that 
        disputing a term.&nbsp; Even if, in common usage, one does not call that 
        state of tranquility and comfort “pleasure,” why should we object to 
        Epicurus doing so, being that its relation to all other things which men 
        give the name of “pleasure,” it is incomparably greater?&nbsp; This has been 
        and always will be allowed in the style of philosophizing, especially 
        here, where pleasure and good, or that which is desirable, are 
        equivalent.&nbsp; This state, which seems to be the best and most desirable 
        thing in the world, ought to be able to be considered “pleasure,” and 
        called so.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Moreover, not only do we have Aristotle to appeal to, whose express 
        words are that “there is a greater pleasure in repose, than in action,” 
        but also to St. Chrysostom, who expresses himself thus: “For what is 
        pleasure, but to be free from anxiety, trouble, fear, and despair, and 
        generally to be exempt from such kind of passions?”&nbsp; Pray, which of 
        these two may be said to truly to enjoy pleasure: he who is furiously 
        distracted by passions, and so continually overcome with vicious lusts, 
        that he has no command of himself; or he who is free from all these 
        disturbances, and rests in philosophy as it were a quiet haven?&nbsp; I may 
        truly call it pleasure, when the soul is in such a state that it is in 
        no way disquieted nor disturbed by any physical passion.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Cicero’s objects that children and animals, being the reflection of 
        uncorrupted nature, have no appetite for the kind of pleasure which is 
        in this state of rest that we have just described, but only the kind 
        which is in motion.&nbsp; This objection seems to carry more weight.&nbsp; But 
        whatever his opinion about animals, and the nature of barbarians, who 
        truly are born depraved – they are still sufficiently educated to obtain 
        their goal, and after having appeased the pain caused by some need, they 
        naturally rest, contrary to many men who, being depraved in their 
        opinion, fool themselves, or make requirements by arousing the appetite, 
        and never stop at anything.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Regardless of the case of animals, I say, and speaking only about men, 
        is it not logical that everything he objects to is easily demolished by 
        what was implied above?&nbsp; To begin with, nature instituted 
        pleasure-at-rest as the principal goal, and because action is the means 
        necessary to obtain it, it was beneficial to institute 
        pleasure-in-motion, so that the action was done with more alacrity.&nbsp; So 
        man or beast seems to be particularly and more obviously excited, or 
        carried away with, pleasure-in-motion.&nbsp; Yet, this does not mean that at 
        the same time it does not also tend, more subtly yet truly, towards 
        pleasure-at-rest, and that by natural instinct, holds it to be the chief 
        end, or the primal goal.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Moreover, because man in the process of time is corrupted (as is widely 
        held by diverse beliefs) such that he mistakes, so to speak, “the chief 
        object with the accessory” (<i>&#964;&#972; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#943;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#941;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#957;)</i>, he holds 
        pleasure-in-motion to be the prime goal, and in abusing this pleasure by 
        his intemperance, he attracts troubles to himself when he loses 
        pleasure-at-rest (which nature made the premiere or principal one), 
        which is followed by sadness and repentance.&nbsp; For this reason, Epicurus 
        supposed that wisdom signifies that man should regulate pleasure, i.e., 
        consider the accessory as an accessory, and the chief object as the 
        chief object.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        However, one should not be dismayed by the objections of the Cyrenaics, 
        who, according to Cicero, complained that the pleasure of Epicurus is 
        like being asleep.&nbsp; For Epicurus believed that tranquility and comfort 
        were not like numbness, but rather a state in which life’s actions were 
        undertaken calmly, and pleasantly, which already was noted above.&nbsp; 
        Although he did not suppose that the life of the wise was like a 
        torrential stream, he also did not suppose it to be like a still and 
        stagnant pool, but rather like the water of a calm and gentle river.&nbsp; It 
        is one of his axioms that when pain is removed, pleasure does not 
        increase, but only varies; as if to say, that after this tranquility and 
        freedom from pain are attained, there is truly nothing more desirable, 
        or comparable – though there remain various pure and guiltless pleasures 
        that, without being abused, are diversified, such as how a field, having 
        become fertile, yields various fruits, or how a prairie is seen to be 
        covered with an admirable variety of flowers when the ground is suitably 
        tempered.&nbsp; For this blessed condition is like a fountain, from where all 
        the pleasures that are pure and sincere are drawn from.&nbsp; For this same 
        reason, one must consider it to be the chief good, in that it is like a 
        universal kind of seasoning by which all the actions of life are 
        sweetened, and by which all pleasures are thus seasoned, and made 
        pleasant, or, to put it another way: it is something without which no 
        pleasure would be pleasurable.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        In fact, what satisfaction can one have if the mind is troubled, or the 
        body is tormented by pain?&nbsp; There is a maxim – “if the container is not 
        clean, all that one puts in it is spoiled.”&nbsp; (<i>Sincerum est nisi vas, 
        quodcumq; infundis atescit.</i>)&nbsp; It is for this reason that if somebody 
        desires pure pleasure, it is necessary that he be prepared to receive 
        them in a pure state, which is ultimately accomplished, as much as it is 
        possible, when one arrives at this state of rest and peace which we are 
        discussing.&nbsp; I say as much as it is possible, because according to what 
        was already noted, the mortal condition does not allow one to be 
        absolutely and perfectly happy, as this chief happiness, entirely devoid 
        of anxiety and pain, and filled with every kind of pleasure, belongs 
        only to God alone, and to those through his kindness pass on to a better 
        life.&nbsp; So in this life some are more, and others are less bothered by 
        anxiety and tormented by pain.&nbsp; He who wants to go about it wisely 
        should endeavor as much as his nature and his weakness permits, to put 
        himself in a state in which he might experience the least anxiety, and 
        as little pain as possible.&nbsp; In doing so, he will obtain the two 
        benefits which comprise the chief good, and which the wise have always 
        recognized to be nearly the only reliable and desirable goods in life: 
        the health of the body and, and that of the mind.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">
        <i>Sunts sanitas &amp; mens gemina vitae bona<br>
        Optandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano.</i></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Moreover, that Epicurus did not advocate his pleasure to be like a 
        stupor, or a deprivation of feeling and action, this may itself be 
        proved by how he conducted himself in his gardens, while in 
        contemplation, or while teaching, or by taking care of his friends.&nbsp; It 
        is enough to say that this state and condition of life gave birth to a 
        certain thought that is the sweetest thing in the world to know: that 
        when somebody recounts the emotional tempests from which he courageously 
        withdrew, and by which others are still besieged, he considered himself 
        anchored in a sheltered port, enjoying a calm and pleasant peace.&nbsp; How 
        sweet it is, Lucretius knew, to view from a mountaintop a ship on the 
        open sea, beaten by winds and waves – not that there is pleasure in 
        seeing the suffering of others, but because it is sweet to be free of 
        the evils of which the others are travailing!</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">
        ’Tis pleasant when the seas are rough, to stand<br>
        And view another’s danger safe at land<br>
        Not ’cause he’s troubled – but sweet to see<br>
        Those cares and fears, from which we are free.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        It is also quite a sweet thing, he adds, to witness from the heights of 
        some tower, two powerful armies arrayed in battle without sharing the 
        danger.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        But nothing is so sweet as seeing oneself elevated by learning and by 
        the great knowledge, from which the temples of wisdom are constructed, a 
        place from where, like an lofty, serene, and tranquil viewpoint, one can 
        witness men going about their business, without knowing what they do, 
        nor what they seek – some tormenting themselves with who will show the 
        most spirit, others adroitly asserting their nobility, and still others 
        working day and night to garner great riches, high offices, and 
        acclamation.&nbsp; Miserable as we are, he goes on to exclaim, does not 
        nature exhort to us something altogether different: to be free from 
        pain, concern, fear, and anxiety, so that our mind enjoys a pleasant 
        tranquility?&nbsp;</p>

        On peace of mind in particular</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Now in addressing peace of mind in particular, let us remind ourselves 
        that in using this term, one does not mean an apathetic and sluggish 
        laziness, or a languid and indolent idleness, but rather, as Cicero 
        conveys from Pythagoras and Plato, “a sweet, and peaceful steadiness of 
        spirit” (<i>placida quietaq; constantia in animi parte rationis principe</i>.)&nbsp; 
        Or, as Democritus says, “an superb steadiness, constitution and sweet 
        temper of mind,” to such a degree that whether he applies himself to 
        businesses or to recreation, or whether he experiences prosperity or 
        hardship, he always remains stable, always being himself, without 
        letting himself get carried away by excessive joy, or letting himself be 
        cut down by sorrow and sadness – in a word, without being disturbed by 
        any sort of untoward passion.&nbsp; Hence, this peace of mind was called 
        “ataraxy” (<i>&#940;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#958;&#943;&#945;</i>), which signifies freedom from anxiety, and 
        from agitation.&nbsp; For just as a ship is known to be at peace not only 
        when it is adrift in the middle of the sea, so it is also, and 
        significantly, when it is carried by a favorable wind, which actually 
        makes it sail swiftly, yet also gently and steadily. Likewise, the mind 
        is known to be a peace not only when it is at rest, but also, and 
        significantly, when it undertakes great and magnificent things without 
        being inwardly disturbed, and without losing its equanimity.&nbsp; On the 
        contrary, a ship is known to be in trouble not only when it is buffeted 
        by headwinds, but when it is thrashed by great waves of rough water.&nbsp; 
        Similarly, the mind is said to be troubled not only, when in action, it 
        is carried away by various passions, but also, when at rest, by 
        concerns, sorrows, and fears which drain away and consume it.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Such are how the 
        passions, and similar things, entirely disrupt one’s composure, 
        thwarting the happy life.&nbsp; Here is what Cicero says about their 
        turbulent motions, and the mental anxieties which are stirred by an 
        unchecked impulsiveness:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The turbulent motions and the 
          disquietude of the mind, which are roused and excited by 
          ill-considered impulse in scorn of all reason, leave no room for a 
          happy life.&nbsp; For who can fail to be miserable with the fear of death 
          or pain upon him, one of which is always close at hand, and the other 
          always threatening?&nbsp; Furthermore, if the same man (and this 
          happens frequently) is afraid of poverty, disgrace, dishonor; if he is 
          afraid of infirmity, blindness, if lastly he is afraid of slavery (the 
          frequent fate, not of individual men, but powerful communities): can 
          anyone be happy with such fears before him?&nbsp; Again, the man who not 
          merely fears such misfortunes in the future, but actually suffers and 
          endures them in the present (adding to the list: exile, sorrow, and 
          death of children), the man who is broken down by such blows and 
          shipwrecked by distress, can such a one by happy who is continually 
          fearing such things?&nbsp; Can he enjoy the least shadow of happiness?&nbsp; 
          Moreover, where we see a man passionately stirred with the madness of 
          lust, desiring all things in a fury of unsatisfied longing, and the 
          more copiously he drains the cup of pleasure wherever offered, the 
          deeper and consuming his thirst, would you not rightly deem him 
          utterly miserable?&nbsp; Again, when a man is frivolously excited, and 
          carried away with empty amusements and reckless extravagance; is he 
          not the more wretched, the more he thinks himself happy?&nbsp; Therefore, 
          as such men are miserable, so on the contrary, happy are those who are 
          not frightened with fears, who do not allow themselves to be overcome 
          with sadness, who are not inflamed with lusts, nor moved by immoderate 
          joys, and on whom the powerful charms and allurements of these soft 
          and effeminate pleasures have no powerful influences.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        And Torquatus asserts that,</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Epicurus, the man 
          whom you denounce as a voluptuary, cries aloud that no one can live 
          pleasantly without living wisely, honorably, and justly, and no one 
          wisely, honorably and justly without living pleasurably.&nbsp; For a city 
          rent by faction cannot prosper, nor a house whose masters are at 
          strife; much less then can a mind divided against itself and filled 
          with inward discord taste any particle of pure and liberal pleasure.&nbsp; 
          But one who is perpetually swayed by conflicting and incompatible 
          counsels and desires can know no peace or calm. Why, if the 
          pleasantness of life is diminished by the more serious bodily 
          diseases, how much more must it be diminished by the diseases of the 
          mind!&nbsp; But extravagant and imaginary desires, for riches, fame, power, 
          and also for licentious pleasures, are nothing but mental diseases.&nbsp; 
          Then, too, there are grief, trouble and sorrow, which gnaw the heart 
          and consume it with anxiety, if men fail to realize that the mind need 
          feel no pain unconnected with some pain of body, present or to come.&nbsp; 
          Yet there is no foolish man but is afflicted by some one of these 
          diseases; therefore there is no foolish man that is not unhappy.&nbsp; 
          Moreover, there is death, the stone of Tantalus ever hanging over 
          men’s heads; and superstition, which poisons and destroys all peace of 
          mind.&nbsp; Besides, they do not recollect their past nor enjoy their 
          present blessings; they merely look forward to those of the future, 
          and as these are of necessity uncertain, they are consumed with agony 
          and terror; and the climax of their torment is when they perceive too 
          late that all their dreams of wealth or station, power or fame, have 
          come to nothing.&nbsp; For they never attain any of the pleasures, the hope 
          of which inspired them to undergo all their arduous toils.&nbsp; Or look 
          again at others, petty, narrow-minded men, or confirmed pessimists, or 
          spiteful, envious, ill-tempered creatures, unsociable, abusive, 
          brutal; others again enslaved to the follies of love, impudent or 
          reckless, wanton, headstrong and yet irresolute, always changing their 
          minds. Such failings render their lives one unbroken round of misery.</p>

        Thus we should mention here that the sweetest delight belongs, by 
        necessity, to he who delivers himself from the anxieties which had 
        troubled him.&nbsp; Recognizing the happy state that he is in, he considers 
        himself, as we already mentioned above, being at rest in a secure port 
        after having been beaten and tormented by the winds and the waves of the

        But we will soon speak about such pleasure in particular when we discuss 
        the virtues, which have the ability to calm the passions, and thus bring 
        about a sweet and pleasant peace of mind.&nbsp; Moreover, this comfort is 
        most appreciated by those longing for it when they find themselves in 
        trouble and in actual distress, just as he who has is beaten by the 
        rough sea, hopes for a respite and good fortune, or as he who is 
        stricken by some violent disease yearns for health; for nobody 
        recognizes the value of these things as well as those who contemplate 
        them in their absence.&nbsp; It is for this reason that I would readily say, 
        like I did before, that one can preserve peace of mind, and thus live

        On life, and active happiness</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        If there be two manners of life, then there are two kinds of happiness: 
        the contemplative one, and the active one.&nbsp; The wise nearly always 
        prefer the contemplative one over the active one.&nbsp; However, this does 
        not prevent those who (by means of birth, ingenuity, happenstance, or 
        necessity) engage in businesses, from being altogether incapable of 
        enjoying a genuine peace of mind.&nbsp; Because he who enters a career does 
        not do so blindly, but only after having for some time, and with dead 
        seriousness, contemplated the state of human affairs, not from a common 
        perspective, but with an elevated one, so that he comprehends that in 
        the real world, a hundred things might happen that all of human wisdom 
        cannot foresee.&nbsp; He thus prepares himself in such a manner (if not 
        specifically, then at least generally) for those difficulties which he 
        might encounter.&nbsp; He is often ready to be obliged, as one might say, to 
        “play it as it goes” – recognizing that he may very well be the master 
        of what is within him, but not of the things which are not of his 
        free-will.&nbsp; He acts within his power, and does what is expected of an 
        honest man.&nbsp; Afterwards, whatever happens, he deems himself to be 
        content and satisfied.&nbsp; He does not fantasize about the certainty of a 
        happy outcome for his undertakings, as things may turn out differently 
        than he wishes them to.&nbsp; Rather, he prepares himself in such a manner 
        that even if he experiences misfortune, he nevertheless bears it with 
        equanimity and patience.&nbsp; Such a one, I say, thus resolved and prepared, 
        will have engaged in businesses, will be able to act with the outside so 
        that in the same midst of volatility, and business troubles, he 
        maintains within himself a comfortable disposition, and tranquility.</p>

        This is what Claudian relates so clearly about Theodosius the Great and 
        which we, without exaggeration, may duly apply to our monarch, truly the 
        Theodosius of France, the true model of a wise prince.&nbsp; Neither the 
        great undertakings he ponders, nor the heavy burden of the state which 
        he manages, ever troubles his peace of mind.&nbsp; Like the lofty summit of 
        Mount Olympus, his spirit is always clear and serene, above the rain, 
        clouds, and thunderstorms.&nbsp; With the winds and the winters far below 
        him, the storm clouds dissolve under his feet and he mocks the thunder 
        and lightning.&nbsp; So his patient, steady, and free spirit, in the midst of 
        such great and varied circumstances, remains always serene, calm, and 
        candid.</p>

        Moreover, once great things are accomplished, the wise man does not 
        rudely aggrandize himself upon success, nor is he dejected by failure.&nbsp; 
        In any case, he never regrets the measures he has taken, because 
        everything being carefully considered, and examined, a successful 
        outcome is more probable, so that he would undertake the same course of 
        action all over again, if the same circumstances were reencountered.</p>

        The example of Photion comes to mind, who counseled against war, which 
        nevertheless turned out victorious; “I am,” he says, “very glad that 
        things turned out as they did.&nbsp; Yet, I don’t at all regret the advice I 
        had given.”&nbsp; This is very similar to Cicero’s judgment, “It becomes a 
        wise man,” he says, “to do nothing against his will, or whatever may 
        cause him to have regrets, but to do all things sedately and 
        deliberately, with a solemn steadiness and constancy of mind, neither 
        supposing things to happen by an unforeseen necessity, nor to admire 
        anything as new and unexpected, but to abide firm and steadfast in his 
        judgment.”&nbsp; The wise man ought not to undervalue the advice of others, 
        and to become overconfident in his own beliefs, but at the same time, 
        upon having carefully deliberated some matter, he ought not, by 
        self-deprecation, to be swayed by popular opinion.</p>

        For this reason, the famous Quintius Fabius Maximus, <i>Cunctator,</i> 
        deserves to be applauded, who preferred the safety of his fatherland to 
        the vain cheers of the people.&nbsp; Photion was of the same temperament, who 
        without worrying that his soldiers accused him of cowardliness because 
        he did not want to lead them into combat, not being too confident in 
        their strength and their courage, answered quite simply, “Oh brave 
        comrades, you will not make me courageous, and I will not make you 
        cowards; it is sufficient that every one should understand his own

        <b>If contemplative happiness is preferable to active happiness</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        All things considered regarding contemplative versus active happiness, 
        Aristotle had reason to favor the former.&nbsp; For contemplation brings out 
        the most excellent and divine parts of us, which is moreover the noblest 
        action – the purest, most constant, most durable, and easiest to make 
        use of.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        We will not repeat here what has already been mentioned above on the 
        first part of virtue, to exhibit the felicity of a wise philosopher, or 
        the satisfaction that there is in the contemplation of things.&nbsp; It will 
        be enough to recount what Cicero writes so astutely: “What pleasures,” 
        he says “are not enjoyed by a thinking mind, which is employed night and 
        day in contemplation and study?&nbsp; What extraordinary delight is it to 
        observe the motions and circumference of the world, the infinite number 
        of stars that shine in the heavens; those seven planets, which being 
        more or less distant the one from the other, according to how higher or 
        lower they are, wandering and uncertain in their motions, and yet never 
        failing to fulfill their course in their appointed time?&nbsp; This sight and 
        consideration of so many excellent things, persuaded the ancient 
        philosophers to proceed to new inquires, to examine the cause and 
        beginning of the world, from whence all things proceed, from whence they 
        are engendered, what differing qualities are crept into their 
        composition, from whence life and death happen, how the alterations and 
        changes of one thing into another came to pass, by what weight the Earth 
        is supported, and how balanced, into what concavities the waters are 
        confined, and how everything pressed by its own weight naturally tends 
        to its own center.&nbsp; Thus by discerning and continually meditating on 
        these wonderful things, we at last arrive at that knowledge which God 
        heretofore recommended to Delphos, namely, that the pure soul having 
        shaken off all vice, should know itself, and find itself united to the 
        divine undertaking, or being.&nbsp; This procures it an everlasting and 
        unspeakable delight; for the contemplation of the power and nature of 
        the gods allows it to have a strong liking for eternity; and when it 
        once perceives the necessary consequence of causes guided and a governed 
        by an eternal wisdom, it believes itself not to be confined to the 
        narrow limits of this life. &nbsp;Therefore it considers human affairs with a 
        marvelous serenity, it is inclined to the practice of virtue, it 
        inquires what the chief good consists of, and the chief evil, what all 
        our actions ought to tend towards, and what is the rule of life we ought 
        to steer by.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Let us add that he who shall have considered the peculiar development of 
        all things since the beginning of the world – the rise, progress, 
        maturity, decline, and demise of kingdoms, republics, religions, 
        opinions, laws, customs, the particular manners, and the ways of life 
        which are presently in effect, and that our forefathers would have 
        rejected, just as those that they regarded seriously, we now mock, and 
        just as those which will be preferred by our descendants, we would 
        nonetheless scoff at, if we could see them – these fashions and customs, 
        though they change in the particulars, can nevertheless generally be 
        known as the same, and are always a mark of the everlasting weakness, 
        and simplemindedness of the humanity at large.&nbsp; This is how it always 
        happens that men, by their blindness, live perpetually in misery.&nbsp; Being 
        carried away by ambition, avarice, or some other passion, they do not 
        recognize how advantageous it is to be free of this care, to be 
        satisfied with little, to live within themselves, and to calmly live 
        life without so much agitation.&nbsp; He, I say, who will have employed his 
        mind in such contemplation, will undoubtedly re-experience extreme joy, 
        and will have been very happy in his contemplation, especially if he 
        considers all things as if from the top of a crowned fortress, from 
        where we said that virtue looks down upon the various actions and 
        occupations of men, their foolish ambition, their notoriety, their 
        vanity, their wicked avarice, and everything else that we already 
        reviewed above.</p>

        On bodily comfort in particular</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Now let us speak about bodily comfort.&nbsp; It seems that it is not as much 
        within our power to be free of pain in the body, as it is within our 
        power to be free of anxiety in the mind.&nbsp; It is difficult to curb the 
        passions, and to stall their progress.&nbsp; Yet, notwithstanding those which 
        are connected to pain, such as hunger and thirst, which beget the desire 
        of food and drink, it seems that those desires which are born within us 
        merely from belief can be kept in check provided that one’s beliefs are 
        kept in check.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        But in considering pains of the body, though we may be on guard not to 
        bring them upon us from without, or to excite them from within, it is 
        still quite normal for our heredity to impose at least some liability to 
        suffering various pains in the course of life.&nbsp; It is certainly not 
        without reason that Aesop imagines that when Prometheus tempered the 
        clay from which he molded man, he did not use water, but tears – meaning 
        that the nature of the human body is such that it is vulnerable to all 
        sorts of abuses, and because it is impossible for none to befall us, one 
        by necessity must suffer some pain.&nbsp; It would be endless to list the 
        sources of misery which can befall us: from tyrants, fools, the 
        careless, from all sorts of organisms, from heat, cold, fever, gout, 
        infections, etc.&nbsp; I note only that he who has on some occasion been 
        tormented by such hardships is in a position to say how strongly he 
        desired, and how much he would have given, to be free from them.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Certainly there has never been anybody, who, while sick and tormented by 
        pain, and seeing others who are doing well, does not believe them to be 
        very happy.&nbsp; It is curious that they do not recognize that they are 
        enjoying so great and considerable of a good, although there is nothing 
        that anyone would trade for it – compared to health, nothing is more 
        valuable.&nbsp; Health has been celebrated since times immemorial; there are 
        books everywhere full of its praises, but I will just mention what an 
        old poet says, that “the best thing bestowable to man, who by his nature 
        is fragile and weak, is the care of one’s health.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">
        <i>Fragili viro optima res bene valere</i>.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Another one says that “if one is healthy, such that one is neither 
        tormented by indigestion nor gout, all the riches of kings would not be 
        any greater, or more considerable.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">

        Now I’ve said all this here in order to make it known that it is not 
        without reason to maintain that bodily comfort, or freedom from pain, is 
        part of what comprises happiness.&nbsp; Surely those pains which are mild, or 
        of short duration, can easily be endured.&nbsp; One may even willingly endure 
        those which are intense, if by doing so one avoids even greater pains, 
        or obtains greater pleasures.&nbsp; Yet, there is nobody who, being in pain, 
        wants pain for its own sake; he would readily let himself out of it if 
        he could obtain the same things without pain.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Zeno and Anaxarchus are celebrated for the integrity with which they 
        spoke against tyrants in their greatest tortures.&nbsp; Calanus and 
        Peregrinus are similarly lauded for freely offering themselves to the 
        flames.&nbsp; But let us suppose that it happened that they could by choice 
        achieve as much glory by some other means than through this suffering – 
        I will let you imagine in good conscience what they would have done.&nbsp; 
        Cicero also greatly extols Posidonius.&nbsp; While being tormented by gout 
        when Pompey visited him at Rhodes, Posidonius was informed that Pompey 
        was very sorry that he could not meet with him.&nbsp; Posidonius replied: 
        “but you can – I will not suffer so great a man who has come to find me 
        to have done so in vain.” &nbsp;&nbsp;He added that he started by articulating a 
        grand speech for him to show that there is nothing good but what is 
        honest, and while the pain impinged him sharply during the discourse, he 
        said several times, “You shall not gain anything, oh pain!&nbsp; As grievous 
        as you are, I will never confess that you are an evil.”&nbsp; But although 
        Posidonius patiently suffered those pains that he could have avoided, 
        wouldn’t you nonetheless believe that he would rather be without pain 
        and to converse without pain if it was possible?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        Accordingly, it could be added here that if pain is the chief evil, it 
        surely follows that freedom from pain is the chief good; especially so, 
        since nature seems to have bestowed upon us an inclination to avoid 
        pain.&nbsp; Because when we happen to be discomforted by pain, either by 
        hunger or by some other desire, we are naturally motivated towards 
        relieving it. And if some pleasure-in-motion intercedes, it is, as we 
        noted, because nature confers sweetness to those actions which are 
        necessary to obtain comfort.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        We should probably also mention by what means one can get so great a 
        good.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the various remedies gained from appropriate 
        precautions and the art of medicine, which have nothing to do with 
        morals, we must say then that the most general and easiest means to 
        obtain physical comfort is <i>temperance,</i> being a careful 
        moderation.&nbsp; Moreover, it is by this virtue that we can, if not drive 
        out altogether, at least mitigate hereditary diseases, avoid many of 
        those maladies which we contract by our own fault, and deliver us from 
        those which are already contracted.&nbsp; Let us say further just that he who 
        enjoys physical comfort can enjoy without regret some of the various 
        kinds of pleasures, many of which relate to the body, as well as those 
        which relate to the mind.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        As freedom from pain is no different than health itself, Plutarch makes 
        the exact comparison between health and the tranquility of the sea, in 
        that the sea gives the opportunity for its inhabitants to breed, and to 
        raise their offspring conveniently; so too does health yield the 
        opportunity for men to carry out all the functions of life conveniently, 
        and without sorrow.&nbsp; This is what he says, though Prodicus elegantly 
        declares that “fire is the greatest seasoning of life.”&nbsp; Nevertheless, 
        one might correct this notion, and build upon it, by saying, “That 
        health is extraordinary delightful, being that no cooked nor roasted 
        meal, nor whatever haute cuisine there is, can bring any delight to 
        those troubled by some illness; whereas in a healthful condition, every 
        morsel is pleasant and appetizing.”&nbsp; Besides, the same can be said of 
        the pleasures which relate to the other senses, since in a sick body 
        those pleasures which are inoffensive and honest – <i>displease;</i> the 
        sense of smell is not refreshed by aromas, nor is the ear flattered by 
        harmony, nor does the sight rejoice in beautiful objects.&nbsp; Moreover, 
        speeches, plays, public shows, walks, hunting, and other similar 
        diversions cannot please, lacking the sweetness that is, as we said, 
        essential to making pleasure <i>pleasurable</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; All this, I say, 
        being true for the pleasures of the body – it is certainly even more so 
        in for the pleasures of the mind.&nbsp; For it happens that one suffers from 
        disease, or acute pain, one is barely able to study, to read, or to 
        concentrate.&nbsp; For as long as consciousness is joined to this fragile and 
        mortal body, there is such a union between the two that the body cannot 
        suffer without consciousness feeling it, and without distracting it, 
        willy nilly, from its more pleasant occupations, for the afflicting pain 
        attracts the entire attention of the mind, and all its thoughts.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        And so, happy are those whose natural condition is such that it allows 
        them to live in bodily comfort, and to take pleasure in the study of 
        wisdom!&nbsp; Happy also are those who, although they have an infirm body, 
        manage themselves with such forethought and self-discipline that if they 
        cannot be altogether free of pain, they at least mitigate it, and render 
        it tolerable, so that they are hardly prevented from enjoying pleasures 
        of the mind!&nbsp; Thus, those in the first category ought to become aware of 
        how they disturb, or corrupt by their overindulgence, their naturally 
        good condition; those in the other must attempt to correct theirs, and 
        to restore bodily comfort as much as possible; and those in both, being 
        everyone, must take care of their body, even it were only for the sake 
        of the mind, which cannot be well when the body is ill.&nbsp; &nbsp;We must always 
        be aware that even though the predominate part of happiness consists in 
        peace of mind, one must not underestimate the remaining part, which 
        consists of bodily comfort.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        It is true that there are some who believe that it is a crime, when 
        considering the chief good, or the happiness of man, to connect the 
        pleasures of the mind to those of the body, and who consequently believe 
        that it is contemptible to associate bodily comfort with peace of mind.&nbsp; 
        But as these tend to be Stoics, or those who presume to imitate them, I 
        cannot help but recite what Cicero himself inveighs against them in 
        response to Cato; he begins by recapitulating the first principles of 
        the Stoics: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Let it be granted, to 
          begin with, that we have an affection for ourselves, and that the 
          earliest impulses bestowed upon us by nature is a desire for 
          self-preservation.&nbsp; On this we are agreed; and the implication is that 
          we must study what we ourselves are, in order to keep ourselves true 
          to our proper character.&nbsp; We are then human beings, consisting of mind 
          and body, and these of a certain kind.&nbsp; These we are bound to esteem, 
          as our earliest natural instinct demands, and out of these we must 
          construct our end, our chief and ultimate good.&nbsp; And, if our premises 
          are correct, this end must be pronounced to consist in the attainment 
          of the largest number of the most important of the things in 
          accordance with nature.&nbsp; This then was the conception of the end that 
          they upheld; the supreme good they believed to be the thing which I 
          have described at some length, but which they more briefly expressed 
          by the formula “life according to nature.”</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Now then, let us call 
          upon your leaders, or better upon yourself (for who is more qualified 
          to speak for your school?) to explain this: how in the world do you 
          contrive, starting form the same first principles, to reach the 
          conclusion that the chief good is morality of life?&nbsp; For that is 
          equivalent to your “life in agreement with virtue” or “life in harmony 
          with nature.”&nbsp; By what means or at what point did you suddenly discard 
          the body, and all those things which are in accordance with nature but 
          out of our control, and lastly duty itself?&nbsp; My question then is, how 
          comes it that so many things that nature strongly recommend have been 
          suddenly abandoned by Wisdom?&nbsp; Even if we were not seeking the chief 
          good of man, but of some living creature that consisted solely of a 
          mind (let us allow ourselves to imagine such a creature exists, in 
          order to facilitate our discovery of the truth), even so, that mind 
          would not accept this end of yours.&nbsp; For such a being would ask for 
          health and freedom from pain, and would also desire its own 
          preservation, and security for the goods just specified; and it would 
          set up as its end to live according to nature, which means, as I said, 
          to possess all or most of the vital things which are in accordance 
          with nature.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;…&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">[Virtue alone, they 
          say, is sufficient to render us happy, and the good of the body are 
          but, as it were, small accessories, which are not capable of rendering 
          life more happy,] but rid a man of a bodily deformity, or agonies of 
          pain, and you earn his deepest gratitude.&nbsp; Even the wise man, if a 
          tyrant sent him to the rack, … seeing that he was about to encounter 
          the supreme antagonist, pain, would summon up all his principles of 
          courage and endurance to fortify himself against that severe and 
          trying struggle.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        And then he goes on to say,</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Self-love is inherent 
          in every species; since what species exists that ever abandons itself 
          or any part of itself, or any habit or faculty of any such part, or 
          any of the things, whether processes or states, that are in accordance 
          with its nature?&nbsp; What species ever forgot its own original 
          constitution?&nbsp; Assuredly there is not one that does not retain its own 
          proper faculty from start to finish.&nbsp; How then came it about that, of 
          all existing species, mankind alone should relinquish man’s nature, 
          forget the body, and find its chief good not in the whole man but in a 
          part of man?</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">…</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">A Phidias can start 
          to make a statue from the beginning and carry it to completion, or he 
          can take one rough-hewn by some on else and finish that.&nbsp; That latter 
          case typifies the job of wisdom. &nbsp;She did not create man herself, but 
          took him over in the rough from nature; her business is to finish the 
          statue that nature began, keeping her eyes on nature meanwhile.&nbsp; What 
          sort of thing then is man as rough-hewn by nature?&nbsp; And what is the 
          function and the task of wisdom? What is it that needs to be 
          consummated by her finishing touch?&nbsp; If it is a creature consisting 
          solely of a certain operation of the intellect, that is, reason, its 
          highest good must be activity in accordance with virtue, since virtue 
          is reason’s consummation.&nbsp; If it is nothing but a body, the chief 
          things will be health, freedom from pain, beauty, and all the rest.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">But as a matter of 
          fact the creature whose chief good we are seeking is man.&nbsp; Surely then 
          our course is to inquire what has been achieved in the whole of man’s 
          nature.&nbsp; All are agreed that the duty and function of wisdom is 
          entirely centered in the work of perfecting man; but then some 
          thinkers (for you must not imagine that I am tilting at the Stoics 
          only) produce theories which place the chief good in the class of 
          things entirely outside our control, as though they were discussing 
          some creature devoid of a mind; while others, on the contrary, ignore 
          everything but mind, just as if man had no body; and that even though 
          the mind is not an empty, impalpable something (a conception 
          unintelligible to me), but belongs to a certain kind of material 
          substance, and therefore even the mind is not satisfied with virtue 
          alone, but desires freedom from pain.&nbsp; In fact, with each school alike 
          it is just as if they should ignore the left side of their bodies and 
          protect the right, or, in the mind, like Herillus, recognize cognition 
          but leave the practical faculty out of account.&nbsp; They pick and choose, 
          pass over a great deal and fasten on a single aspect; so that all 
          their systems are one-sided.&nbsp; The full and perfect philosophy was that 
          which, investigating the chief good of man, left no part either of his 
          mind or body uncared for.&nbsp; Whereas your friends, Cato, on the strength 
          of the fact, which we all admit, that virtue is man’s highest and 
          supreme excellence and that the wise man is the perfect and consummate 
          type of humanity, try to dazzle our mental vision with virtue’s 
          radiance.&nbsp; Every animal, for instance, the horse, the dog, has some 
          supreme good quality, yet at the same time they require to have health 
          and freedom from pain; similarly therefore, in man that consummation 
          you speak of attains its chief glory in what is his chief excellence, 
          namely virtue.&nbsp; …&nbsp; We started to look for a virtue that should 
          protect, not abandon, nature; but virtue as you conceive it protects a 
          particular part of our nature and leaves the remainder in a lurch.&nbsp; 
          Yet, man’s constitution, if it could speak, would declare that its 
          earliest tentative movements of desire were aimed at preserving itself 
          in the natural character with which it was born into the world.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
        As for the rest, we are not ignorant of what is usually said in the 
        litany against pleasure – that it is the major plague of man, the mortal 
        enemy of reason, that it shuts the eyes of wisdom, that it has nothing 
        in common with virtue, that it is the source of treacheries, the ruin of 
        nations, the root of all crimes, that it squanders inheritances, blasts 
        our reputations, that it stresses the body, making it vulnerable to 
        diseases, and finally that it hastens old age, and death. </p>

        and the chief good, we do not refer to those sordid and debauched kinds 
        of pleasures, but simply peace of mind, and bodily comfort.&nbsp; Plainly,

        It is not without cause, as we’ve previously stated, that the truest and 
        most general means of obtaining and preserving the kind of pleasure 
        necessary for a happy life is to cultivate temperance.&nbsp; By moderating 
        our desires, cutting off what’s unnecessary and useless, and limiting 
        ourselves to just what’s natural and necessary, we accustom ourselves to 
        being content with getting by with little; for this is how one can 
        preserve that comfortable peace of mind which is the main ingredient of 
        happiness.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        No one who limits himself to natural and necessary things is enormously 
        disturbed and tormented, because these things are found everywhere and 
        are extremely easy to obtain.&nbsp; Great turmoil and mental anguish afflict 
        only those who are not content with what is necessary and impulsively 
        pursue what is superfluous.&nbsp; And if they do not obtain them, they are 
        violently distressed; if they do obtain them, they apprehensive about 
        losing them; if they do lose them, they die of sorrow for it; and when 
        they still have them, they are never satisfied with them.&nbsp; They cope 
        with their mind like the sieve of the Danaides; they never can rest, but 
        are always roused by some new desire as if by some kind of madness, so 
        that they seem always to undertake some new labor.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Temperance is also the sure way to obtain and preserve the pleasure of 
        bodily comfort, which comprises the other part of happiness, for he who 
        is satisfied with life’s necessities are not obliged to suffer immense 
        pain and exhaustion like those who pursue vanity.&nbsp; He does not do 
        anything to undermine his health and he does not make himself vulnerable 
        to any of those discomforts which intemperance causes.&nbsp; Those who live 
        frugally and simply are not particularly vulnerable to diseases, unlike 
        those who eat excessively or those who consume manufactured meals, 
        saturated with sauces by the artifice of cooks.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Epicurus plainly recognized the importance and the excellence of this 
        modesty, or moderation, i.e., satisfaction with little, when he 
        exclaims, “To be satisfied with necessities is to be wealthy indeed!&nbsp; 
        Poverty, in proportion to the decree of nature, is a great endowment and 
        treasury of riches.&nbsp; Now if you would be rightly informed what those 
        proper bounds and limits are, which this law of nature prescribes, they 
        are these: not to hunger, nor to thirst, and not to be cold.”&nbsp; <i>Non 
        esurire, non sitire, non algere.</i></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        This is what he had experienced within himself, if we follow the 
        testimony of Juvenal: </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph">If any ask me what would satisfy<br>
        To make life easy, thus I would reply:<br>
        As much as keeps out hunger, thirst and cold<br>
        As much as made wise Epicurus blessed,<br>
        Who in small Gardens spacious realms possessed.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Seneca declares, “This is a commendable thing: a pleasant and contented 
        poverty – but if it be pleasant, it is <i>not</i> poverty, for whosoever 
        is satisfied with poverty, is rich.&nbsp; He is not poor who enjoys but 
        little – rather he who desires more [is poor].”&nbsp; That is to say, riches 
        themselves ought to be valued for the sake of their end, which is 
        nothing other than joy, satisfaction, pleasure – while poverty, on the 
        contrary, by the deprivation of this end.&nbsp; So it would therefore be 
        consistent to say that a cheerful poverty is not poverty, but great 
        wealth; conversely, a melancholy affluence is not wealth, but great 
        poverty.&nbsp; The traveler who sings on the road in full view of bandits is, 
        in effect, rich; poor is he who, laden with money, fears guns and 
        swords, and trembles with fear upon seeing the shadow of a reed stirring 
        in the moonlight.&nbsp; The tradesman, while he is without money, rejoices in 
        his song which reverberates throughout the neighborhood, and is rich; 
        but stumbling upon a lost purse renders him impoverished, for he is 
        stupefied by the fear and anxiety of losing it.&nbsp; In sum, pray tell me 
        which of two men at the end of their lives dies richest: he who was 
        destitute of things one usually calls riches yet lived joyfully, or he 
        who, profusely supplied in material goods, lived his life in anxiety and 
        sorrow?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Cicero seems to be quite delighted with the type of virtue and 
        moderation of temper that obliges us to live and be content with 
        little.&nbsp; For after he had upheld the examples of Socrates and Diogenes 
        to show that the burden of poverty may be made more easy, he alludes to 
        the words of Epicurus: “Oh, what little does nature desire, what a small 
        matter suffices it!” &nbsp;He asserts that “wisdom is often discovered under 
        mean apparel.”&nbsp; It’s as if he had undertaken to write the praises of 
        this philosopher, for he continues his discourse in this manner, “What 
        then?&nbsp; Those glorious orators – are they more courageous and more 
        generous than Epicurus in encountering Poverty, which troubles mankind 
        so much?&nbsp; Other philosophers seem to be as well-prepared as he was 
        against all evils, yet there is none whom poverty does not terrify; but 
        for his part, very little satisfies him, and none has ever discoursed 
        about frugality better than he: for as he was altogether averse to 
        whatever might cause the desire of riches, lust, ambition, sumptuous 
        expenses or debauchery…&nbsp; Why should he take care to obtain them, or be 
        eager to pursue them?&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Shall Anacharsis the Scythian be able to 
        despise riches, …, and shall our philosophers not be able to do 
        likewise?”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Here are the contents of one of this Scythian’s letters:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Instead of rich and glorious 
          apparel, I use the simple habit of our country; for shoes: the bottoms 
          of my feet well hardened.&nbsp; The ground is my bed, hunger is my sauce.&nbsp; 
          I live upon milk, cheese and meat.&nbsp; Therefore if you come to see me, 
          you will find a man very quiet, and as for the presents which you have 
          been pleased to honor me, give them to your fellow citizens, or offer 
          them to the immortal gods.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">All the philosophers of every 
          school, excepting those of whom whose brutal nature has shunned 
          reason, have been of this persuasion.&nbsp; When Socrates, at a public 
          rejoicing, saw much gold and silver carried about and exposed to 
          public view, cried aloud, “How many things there are, which I don’t at 
          all desire!”&nbsp; When Xenocrates understood that the ambassadors of 
          Alexander had brought him fifty talents, which was a considerable sum 
          of money at that time in Athens, he invited the ambassadors to supper 
          in the Academy, and caused them to be entertained with things moderate 
          and convenient, free from luxury and excess.&nbsp; The next day they 
          desired him to ask them whom upon should they bestow that money they 
          had brought to him?&nbsp; “What?” he asked, “Did you not take notice 
          yesterday by the supper that I gave you, that I have no need of 
          money?”&nbsp; But when he perceived that his refusal gave them offense he 
          accepted some thirty <i>minae</i>, so that he might not seem to 
          despise the King’s liberality.&nbsp; As for Diogenes the Cynic, he treated 
          him more unreservedly, for when Alexander asked him what he stood in 
          need of, answered, “at present I need nothing, but that you would not 
          interpose yourself between me and the sunshine.”&nbsp; This Cynic was wont 
          to prefer his own happiness to that of the King of Persia and to boast 
          how much his life and his fortune was more blessed than this monarch’s 
          – he for his part wanting nothing, whereas the other could never have 
          enough. He desired none of those pleasures, which ultimately never 
          satisfied the King anyway; he was content with his own, which the King 
          could never be.</p>

        This that I have mentioned concerning Diogenes reminds me what Seneca 
        and Maximus of Tyre have written.&nbsp; The former has showed:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">… that great estates are often 
          troublesome and the cause of sorrow and mischief; that the rich suffer 
          not more easily the loss of goods than the poor; that it is far more 
          tolerable not to acquire something than to lose it.&nbsp; So those whom 
          Fortune never favored seem to be happier than those whom it has 
          forsaken.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        After he had demonstrated this at large, he then proceeds:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This is what Diogenes, that great 
          soul, understood, when he put himself into such a condition that 
          nothing could be taken from him.&nbsp; “Call this poverty, destitution, or 
          give whatever disdainful title you please to this tranquility, I shall 
          believe that Diogenes is not happy if you can find anybody else from 
          whom nothing can be taken.&nbsp; Truly if any question the happiness of 
          Diogenes, he may as well question the condition of the immortal gods, 
          and whether they are les happy, because they have not possessions 
          subject to the capricious changes of fortune, and which can be taken 
          away.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        As for Maximum of Tyre, he puts it this way, regarding whether the 
        Cynical life was to be preferred to any other:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Diogenes was neither an Attic nor 
          a Dorian, nor tutored in the schools of Salon or Lycurgus, for neither 
          places nor laws communicate virtue.&nbsp; He was born in the town of Synope, 
          at the bottom of Pontus Euxinus.&nbsp; When he had consulted Apollo, he 
          forsook all the occasions of grief and trouble, he delivered himself 
          from his fetters, and like a wise and free bird, passed through the 
          world without fearing the tyrants, without binding himself to any 
          particular laws, without applying himself to the administration of 
          public affairs, without being troubled in the education of children, 
          without being encumbered by matrimony, without toiling himself with 
          the cultivating of the ground, without engaging himself in the 
          carrying out of war, without trafficking merchandise by sea or land; 
          for he laughed at all these sorts of men, and at their several 
          stations of life as we commonly laugh at children who we observe so 
          intent to play with trifles, until they often fight and hurt one 
          another.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">He led the life of an 
          independent, being free from fears and anxieties.&nbsp; In winter seasons 
          he did not by long fatiguing journeys approach the Babylonians, nor in 
          the summer the Medes; but according to the season, and from the 
          Isthmus, according to the season, and from the Isthmus to Attica 
          again.&nbsp; His royal palaces were the temples, the colleges, and the 
          sacred woods.&nbsp; His riches very large and secure, and not being 
          circumscribed, were not easily subject to ambushes, they being the 
          whole earth with all the fruits it bore, and the fountains that it 
          affords, more excellent than the wines of Lesbos and Chios.&nbsp; He 
          habituated himself also to all sorts of weather as lions do, and would 
          not avoid the changing of the seasons, appointed by Jupiter; neither 
          did he consider any means to secure himself from them; but accustomed 
          himself in such a manner to all seasons, by this kind of living, so 
          that he secured this health and strength, without any assistance from 
          medicine, without experiencing the sharpness of the scalpel or 
          cautery, without imploring the help of Chiron, or of Esculapius or 
          Asclepiades, and without submitting to the prophecies of soothsayers, 
          or to magical and superstitious purifications, or to the vanity of 
          conjurations.&nbsp; At the same time that all Greece was in arms and 
          uproar, and all the neighboring nations were at war with one another, 
          he alone experienced it as if it were a truce with all the earth, and 
          having overcome fighting, was without arms in the midst of armed men.&nbsp; 
          Nay, even the basest of men, the tyrants and his very slanderers, had 
          a respect for him and would not in the least hurt him, though he 
          reproved them, objecting and lampooning their actions before their 
          very eyes, which is a very safe and very convenient way of reproach – 
          reminding men of peace and reason.</p>

        We may at this point add what Seneca reports as coming from the school 
        of Epicurus: “those who happily enjoy luxury are those who do not have a 
        need for it, and he among them who is in the least need of riches, 
        enjoys them the most.”&nbsp; For as luxury consists mainly in the ostentation 
        of riches; he who believes he has not need of them, and who, 
        consequently, does not fear losing them, can assuredly make a very 
        pleasant use of them – more especially since he who does need riches are 
        apprehensive about losing them, as apprehension and anxiety do not allow 
        one to enjoy what he has.&nbsp; He goes on to say:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The miserable wretch passionately 
          desires to increase his stockpiles more and more, and while he is 
          blinded with greed, he forgets to enjoy them.&nbsp; He examines his 
          receipts, prepares his accounts, goes to the exchange, turns over his 
          calendar, and to be a rich man he becomes a creditor.&nbsp; We shall be 
          rich with much greater satisfaction when we understand that to be poor 
          is not as mischievous as we suppose.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        How charming was Socrates, when contemplating the great quantity and 
        diversity of things in the marketplace, he was able to exclaim, “How 
        many things there are, which I don’t at all desire!”&nbsp; Likewise, somebody 
        who perhaps gains possession of all these things and contemplates his 
        houses, his pieces of furniture, his servants, his table, his clothing, 
        and so on – he is entirely well-to-do and may yet be able to say, 
        “Indeed I have all that, but I could live just as well without the 
        things I do not absolutely need.&nbsp; I could sleep comfortably in a less 
        magnificent house, and less well-appointed; I could easily get by 
        without such a great number of servants, these exquisite meals, and 
        these magnificent clothes.”&nbsp; If anyone, I say, maintains this attitude, 
        he is surely able to enjoy his prosperity most agreeably.&nbsp; He shall 
        understand that he can, very comfortably, do without an infinity of 
        things, for the possessiveness which is engendered by them greatly 
        dispel a peaceful life.&nbsp; He shall be all the more prepared to bear their 
        loss gracefully, if some misfortune might plunder him.&nbsp; He shall 
        understand that these things are not absolutely necessary.&nbsp; He shall 
        likewise distance himself from the many pains, labors, and troubles that 
        are usually suffered in order to increase them, realizing that he cannot 
        enjoy truer and purer pleasure with greater wealth, though he can enjoy 
        the same pleasure with less.&nbsp; That which he might amass further would be 
        of no benefit to him – but only to ungrateful heirs, spendthrifts, 
        sycophants, or robbers; and to obtain it he would have to give up 
        relaxation, and cast himself in a sea of problems, pains, and sorrows.</p>

        Here we may also observe that Seneca had good reason to recount this 
        other maxim of Epicurus, that “If any man having all the necessities of 
        life thinks himself not rich enough, then even if he were the lord of 
        the entire world, he would still be miserable.”&nbsp; For if anyone of modest 
        means does not believe that he is able to live as happily as those who 
        he perceives to be more eminent, and more splendid than him, then surely 
        if he was entirely as fortunate as them, or even more so, he would not 
        become any happier for it – rather, he would always be just as unhappy.&nbsp; 
        He would never be satisfied because of the restless nature of his 
        passion, and his covetousness, which, once they have surpassed the 
        bounds prescribed by nature, become immeasurable, and he may never find 
        the ability to fulfill them.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Regarding Epicurus’ other celebrated maxim, “what is necessary to 
        nature, is easy to acquire, and if something is difficult, it is not 
        necessary” – this is a maxim which Stobeus and others borrowed from 
        Epicurus and put into similar words.&nbsp; “Let thanks be returned to kind 
        Nature, which has so arranged everything that what is necessary is 
        easily obtained, and what is difficult, is not necessary.”&nbsp; Cicero is of 
        the same opinion, when he makes Epicurus say, “That he judged that 
        Nature alone was sufficient to make a wise man rich, and that natural 
        riches are easy to be gotten, for Nature is content with little.”&nbsp; And 
        Seneca says that, “According to the judgment of Epicurus, not to hunger, 
        not to thirst, not to feel cold, are the limits that nature prescribes 
        to itself; that to satisfy hunger and thirst, there is no need of 
        dwelling in luxurious palaces, nor to restrain ourselves with 
        supercilious and sullen severity, nor to venture on the ocean, nor to 
        follow armies.&nbsp; That which nature requires is easily obtained, and 
        obvious to all the world.&nbsp; Sweat is the price of superfluities, which 
        make the magistrates attend courts, the generals their tents, and the 
        pilots their ships in the midst of the dangerous and tempestuous seas.”</p>

        condition which those necessities go amiss.&nbsp; But as for Mother Nature, 
        she is surely no niggard with regard to men – she who is the mother 
        nurse of all creatures!&nbsp; And if she did subject them to hunger, she also 
        gave them her fruits, her herbs, and her grains to appease it; if she 
        subjected them to thirst, she also provided them with water in total 
        abundance.&nbsp; If the weather is cold, or if it is hot, she also made them 
        sufficiently thick-skinned to endure these assaults, as experienced with 
        the skin on the face.&nbsp; And if she made the parts of the body more tender 
        and delicate, she also afforded them the shade of trees, caves and other 
        refreshments; and for warmth, she provides the sun, fire, the wool of 
        sheep, and so many other helpful things.</p>

        She has also given us as much foresight and prudence, like the ant, so

        future – though many times we despise the example of that small 
        creature, who, after winter approaches, never leaves his little cave, 
        but in a wise and prudent manner, as Horace knew, subsists calmly 
        through winter with what it had piled up during the summer.</p>

          of his own accord.&nbsp; The things that are able to hurt us, he has hid 
          away far from us – so we may only blame ourselves when, in spite of 
          Nature, we have endeavored to fetch them out of the very bowels of the 
          earth.&nbsp; We have cast ourselves blindfold into sensual pleasures, which 
          are the source of all evils.&nbsp; We have suffered ourselves to be carried 
          away with ambition, glory, and vanity.&nbsp; What advice therefore can I 
          now give you?&nbsp; Nothing new, for they are not new only, for which we 
          seek a remedy.&nbsp; The first thing that we should do is to look into 
          ourselves, and to carefully distinguish necessities from 
          superfluities.&nbsp; Necessities abound in every place, while that which is 
          superfluous confers trouble and aggravation in the procuring of it.&nbsp; 
          Don’t think that you have any great cause to flatter yourselves if you 
          have rejected supple couches, rich jewels, and costly and stately 
          furniture. &nbsp;You will have occasion to marvel at yourselves when you 
          have contemned necessities.&nbsp; It is no great matter to be able to 
          submit, without this great and royal state, without having feasted on 
          the brains of peacocks, the wings of pheasants, nor the other 
          extravagancies of luxury which require us to favor some species of 
          animals, and despise the rest.&nbsp; I shall value you when you will not 
          despise a piece of dry bread, when you shall be persuaded that the 
          herbs grow not only in time of need for the benefit of animals, but 
          for men also, and when you shall have learned that the fruits of trees

        obtain the same pleasures wholesomely and shamelessly.&nbsp; This is what our 
        poet must have had in mind when he implores us to shun grandeur, being 
        certain that one can, in a small house, live happier than kings and 
        bigwigs in their palaces.</p>

        But let us learn from Porphyry how thoroughly Epicurus lived a simple 
        and frugal life, proclaiming that he could also go to the extent of 
        total abstinence from meat:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">We have established what the 
          common people do not believe: that the Epicureans themselves, who hold 
          pleasure to be their end, are for the most part content, since the 
          days of their chieftain, with fruits, vegetables, and broth; and that 
          their philosophy mainly tends to teach nothing more than that nature 
          is satisfied with little, that the plainest food and the easiest to 
          attain satisfies our wants plentifully, and that what is over and 
          above only indulge our insatiable appetites, which is neither in 
          itself necessary, nor can be justified as useful, without which might 
          cause the ruin of the whole.&nbsp; Rather, it springs from vain and foolish 
          beliefs, which prejudice us.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">They say also that a philosopher 
          ought to be convinced that nothing important shall be lacking to him 
          the remainder of his days.&nbsp; Now there is nothing better able to 
          convince him of this than to believe, by his own experience, that he 
          only has need of very little, and that these things are common and 
          easy to be gotten, while that which is over and above is needless, 
          having to do with nothing but luxury and excess, which are only 
          acquired with a great deal of pain and difficulty.&nbsp; So that all the 
          benefit and pleasure that might abound from them, do not compensate 
          for the labor and toil undergone in the obtaining of them, and our 
          continual care to preserve them.&nbsp; Besides, when the thoughts of death 
          approach, we easily forsake little things, or such as are of a mean 
          value and common.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">They say moreover that the 
          consumption of meat compromises our health, because our health is 
          preserved by those very things which recover it when we have lost it. 
          &nbsp;It is recovered by a light diet and abstinence from meat, and is 
          therefore preserved by the same means.&nbsp; But it is no wonder that the 
          public believes that consumption of meat is necessary for our health, 
          for they are persuaded that all the pleasures which are in motion and 
          gratifying are healthy – the pleasures of love included, which are 
          never good for anything, and often very harmful.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Horace had also well-recognized the advantages brought by a sober and 
        frugal life, when he says that there is nothing which contributes to 
        health better than that of drinking and eating little, and to be 
        satisfied with the simplest meals and beverages, and to be persuaded of 
        the truth of this, one only need to recall a small, simple and meager 
        supper that one has already eaten; whereas when one gorges oneself with 
        all kinds of foodstuffs, some are converted into bile and others into 
        gas, which causes flatulence and indigestion in the stomach.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><i>Aciippe nunc 
          victus tenuis quae quantaque secum<br>
          Afferat…<br>
          … imprimis valeas bene; am variae res<br>
          Ut noceant homini, credas memor illuis efea<br>
          Quae simplex olim tibi cesserit: at simul assis<br>
          Miscueris elixa, simul conchulia turdis;<br>
          Dulcia se in bilem vertent, stomachoque tumultum<br>
          Lenta feret pituita.&nbsp; Vides ut pallidus omnes<br>
          Caena desurgat dubia…</i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        We must certainly be astonished that men, who are capable of 
        intelligence and reason, have so little regard for the manner of their 
        diet.&nbsp; Compared to all other things, they pay the least attention to 
        it.&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        First of all, we should postpone eating until the proper time; hunger 
        itself signals the hour of this necessity.&nbsp; Hunger is the purest 
        seasoning, and also the sweetest and most pleasant.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Secondly, eating a simple and frugal meal replenishes the strength of 
        the body and invigorates the mind, which need not expect the diversity, 
        abundance, mixture, and alteration of food presented on splendid 
        tables.&nbsp; As for those gourmands who indulge their gluttonous and 
        fleeting pleasures by gorging the body and dulling the mind – if fevers, 
        gout, and other maladies do not strike them right away, the causes of 
        these evils remain hidden in the body, having been carried to its parts 
        by the contaminated blood which was poisoned by what they ate.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Thirdly, after hunger is appeased and one leaves the table, he who has 
        eaten well and modestly leaves knowing that he has done nothing to 
        compromise his health, which is safeguarded by his moderation.&nbsp; He 
        doesn’t miss experiencing the pleasure of gorging gourmands, more 
        especially when the pleasure is already gone, leaving only the 
        apprehension for bad consequences.&nbsp; He is not liable, unlike those who 
        stuff the stomach with meats and sauces, and may already be repentant, 
        or suspects that he will soon regret it, and that he will suffer, if not 
        soon, then at least some day, the sorrow for his gluttony.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Fourthly, it is indeed wise to avoid subjecting the body to an appetite 
        for short-term pleasures, which are the cause of so many grueling and 
        protracted diseases that are only cured through subjection to various 
        medicines, purgings, vomiting, and bleeding.&nbsp; They ruin the body, even 
        though they can be easily avoided simply by abstinence so that one is 
        not obliged to exclaim, like Lysimachus after surrendering to the Getae 
        to allay his thirst and that of his entire army, “Oh gods! &nbsp;So much I 
        have lost, merely for one fleeting pleasure!”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Fifthly, with the exception of hereditary diseases (which, if they 
        cannot be completely cured, can at least be treated) the general cause 
        of all other diseases is drinking and eating unhealthily or 
        excessively.&nbsp; Though stress, heat, cold, and other such causes can 
        generate diseases, it usually happens because they set afloat the 
        excessive humors which were previously produced in our bodies by excess 
        wine and self-abuse.&nbsp; It might also be noted that during the great 
        plague which infected all of Attica, that none other than Socrates, by 
        virtue of his extraordinary restricted diet, was untouched by it, and we 
        are not unacquainted with one in our days who by similar means was saved 
        from a great epidemic.&nbsp; I might also mention, though not by name, a 
        person of great eminence, who being severely tormented by gout, was 
        persuaded somewhat by my advice to live a year very abstemiously and not 
        to eat hardly any meat (in the manner of the Indians who are healthy and 
        vigorous without it).&nbsp; He is now delivered from all his discomforts, 
        just as long before him the senator Rogatianus was, whom Porphyry speaks 
        about in <i>The Life of Plotinus.</i>&nbsp; So how true it is that a light 
        diet is the main remedy to avoid diseases, or to cure them!</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Sixthly, that for each person who is sick from malnutrition, there are 
        twenty who are sick from repletion; such is why Theognides had good 
        reason to say that gluttony has put an end to many more than hunger.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><i>Perplures quam 
          direa fames, satias male perdit,<br>
          Qui justo cupiunt amplius esse sibi.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        And Horace, following Epicurus, tells us “that an abstemious man, or who 
        drinks and eats little, is always vigorous, and always ready to go to 
        work; whereas wine makes the body heavy, and clouds the mind, and sinks 
        the divine soul to the very ground.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><i>… quin corpus 
          onustum<br>
          Hesternis vitiis, aninum quoque praegravat una,<br>
          Atque affigit humo divinae particulam aura:<br>
          Alter ubi dicto citius curate sopori<br>
          Membra dedit, vegetus praescripta ad munera surgit.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        One can similarly add that he who eagerly pursues the pleasure of the 
        palate loses the pleasure that could otherwise be found by accustoming 
        oneself to living abstemiously and simply.&nbsp; However, one may 
        occasionally have a feast without impropriety.&nbsp; This is sometimes 
        permissible for well-mannered people, and recognized by our poet, when a 
        formal celebration invites us to rejoice, effectively restoring our 
        strength weakened by fasting or old age.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Sive diem festum rediens advexerit annus,<br>
          Sive recreare volet tenuatum corpus; ubique<br>
          Accedent anni, et tractari mollies aetas<br>
          Imbecilla volet…</i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        We ought not to make that particular pleasure of the palate our 
        objective; rather, we ought to consider its gratification as 
        supplementary.&nbsp; An abstemious and frugal life is as good as any.&nbsp; 
        Besides, a wise man is expected, as much as the circumstances of his 
        life allow, to live in accordance with consistent principles.&nbsp; I say “as 
        much as circumstances allow,” because life, being what it is, creates 
        situations when it is difficult to exactly maintain the standards of 
        one’s ideals.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is not extremely difficult to follow 
        them very closely, provided that one has as much integrity and 
        resolution as true wisdom and virtue require.&nbsp; But if one is so weak 
        that he is carried away with overindulgence at the slightest temptation, 
        it is an obvious sign that wisdom and virtue are not rooted very deeply 
        into his soul.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Indeed, if on occasion we find ourselves obliged to attend a banquet, 
        when it may seem impolite to refuse anything offered to us, this is 
        mainly where discipline should be shown – and fortitude.&nbsp; And if a civil 
        excuse and honesty is not enough, we should then be exempt from <i>
        dusopia</i> – that ridiculous sensitivity to shame condemned by the 
        Greeks.&nbsp; Following the advice of Plutarch, one ought to speak clearly 
        and courageously to one’s host, just as Creon did in one of his 
        tragedies: “it is better that you should be angry with me today, than I 
        be unwell tomorrow, having obeyed you.”</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Te praestat infesum, Hospes, esse nunc mihi<br>
          Quam si obsequutus deinde graviter ingemam.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        “For to cast ourselves,” he says, “into a fit of colic, or into some 
        extreme agony, merely to avoid being looked down upon as a buffoon, or 
        as impolite, is to become both a buffoon and a madman – and shows no 
        understanding about how we ought to behave ourselves among men when it 
        comes to eating and drinking.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        We must not here forget that excellent saying of Epicurus, which says 
        that “a modest and frugal life, unto which we have by long use 
        habituated ourselves, makes us invulnerable to the assaults of fortune.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        And as Horace says, “Who will be more able to trust himself and his own 
        strength in the face of accidents and other misfortunes which might 
        happen? &nbsp;He who has accustomed himself to vast requirements, a superb 
        appetite, and luxury, or he who is content with little, and foreseeing 
        the future wisely, will have made provisions during times of peace for 
        what is necessary in war?&nbsp; Let fortune go after this man and take from 
        him all that she can – how much can she deprive him of what is 
        necessary?”</p>
        <blockquote>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        Nor are we to forget what [according to Seneca] Epicurus boasts of, 
        “That his daily food did not quite amount to one pound, and that of 
        Metrodorus weighed but just a pound.”&nbsp; Nor should we omit that excellent 
        advice which Seneca delivered so well:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">You do not perhaps believe that a 
          meager quantity of food is enough to satisfy nature?&nbsp; There is, and to 
          spare!&nbsp; For there is pleasure – not a light and transitory pleasure 
          that we must replenish every moment, but a more fixed and lasting 
          pleasure without interruption.&nbsp; For a draught of water and a piece of 
          barley bread are things not very pleasant to the taste, but then it is 
          a great pleasure that we can confine ourselves to that which 
          misfortune cannot deprive us of.&nbsp; The allowance of a prison is more 
          sumptuous and plentiful, and a convict who is kept in chains, 
          condemned to death, subsists with a small pittance.&nbsp; What an honor it 
          is to willingly settle for that which is not dreaded by those who are 
          reduced to the lowest state! By this means we shall preempt the 
          treachery of fortune, and halt all her prospects.&nbsp; For what power can 
          fortune have over he who disowns those things which she rejoices in 
          giving and taking away, and is satisfied with that which doesn’t 
          depend on her, thinking it too miserable to stoop to her proud empire?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        I’ll here cite what Xenophon tells us of Socrates.&nbsp; “He lived upon so 
        small a pittance, that there was no handicraftsman, if he took never so 
        little pains, but might get more than was needful to nourish him.”&nbsp; That 
        which has been already said of Anacharsis, “that he sent back the money 
        offered him, because he needed it not to supply his slender expenses.”&nbsp; 
        And it is reported of Epaminondas that he sent back the king’s 
        ambassadors with the gold they had brought; and when he had treated them 
        to a plain dinner, he told them, “Go and give an account to your master 
        of this dinner, so that he may understand that a man content with this 
        is not to be bought with money.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        I could, I say, add several more famous examples showing that he who is 
        satisfied with few things, which even poverty may afford, has no cause 
        to fear the iniquity of fortune, nor neediness.&nbsp; But let us simply 
        finish with what Bion says so well in the writings of Theletes the 
        Pythagorean.&nbsp; Here are his words:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">If things in nature 
          could speak like we do, would they not, if I may say so, accost us in 
          this manner:&nbsp; “Why do you argue with me, oh man?&nbsp; Are you for my sake 
          deprived of the advantages of temperance, of justice, or fortitude?&nbsp; 
          Are you afraid that things needful will be wanting to you?&nbsp; Why, are 
          not the highways full of herbs and the fountains running over with 
          water?&nbsp; Don’t I afford you, all over the earth, beds to lie down upon 
          and leaves to cover you?&nbsp; Why can’t you rejoice with me?&nbsp;&nbsp; Haven’t you 
          seen Gradiaphyrtus, a beggar, singing pleasantly, when he eats his 
          meal?&nbsp; Have not I provided sauce for you without the least expense or 
          care, i.e., hunger?&nbsp; And is it not true that he who is hungry relishes 
          his meal robustly, without the help of any artificial incentive, just 
          as he who is thirsty drinks large draughts of pure water with great 
          desire and pleasure?&nbsp; Do you think that men are hungry for a cake or 
          thirsty for snow?&nbsp; And are not these the things that the extravagance 
          and the decadence of spoiled men require?</p>

        A description of the Diogenes of India</b></p>

        In connection with this whole topic, it would seem that I better not 
        omit what I know concerning the lifestyle of the Eastern Indians.&nbsp; This 
        may show that all these fine ideas which we have just discussed are not 
        purely philosophical speculations, but that there are whole populations 
        which lead such a frugal life, and who are also satisfied with little, 
        either for drinking, eating, or clothing, as are the Cynics, Stoics, and 
        Epicureans. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        There is in the Indies a number of fakirs, or religious idolaters, 
        which, like Diogenes, go about in the nude, and like him, has only for 
        shoes the hardened soles of their feet.&nbsp; For a hat, they wear their long 
        braided and oiled hair, trussed up atop their heads; to ornate their 
        fingers, they grow their nails sometimes more than half the length of 
        the small finger; for a house, the galleries of their temples; their bed 
        is comprised from a few inches of ashes, though when they go on a 
        pilgrimage they bring along a tiger-skin or leopard-skin rug to lay upon 
        the ground.&nbsp; Their drink is pure water, and their food, when it is 
        supplied by means of alms: a pound of <i>kichery,</i> which is certain a 
        mixture of rice and of two or three kinds of lentils, the whole cooked 
        with water and salt, and topped with a bit of brown butter.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
        The lifestyle of the Brahmans, or Brahmins, hardly differs from that of 
        the fakirs either in quantity or quality, because the basic and main 
        meal is always kichery – never meat, and never any other beverage than 
        water.&nbsp; The same goes for most merchants, who are called <i>banyans; </i>
        however prosperous they may become, their food is neither more abundant, 
        nor more delicious than that of the Brahmans, and yet they live at least 
        as peacefully, happily, and as contentedly as us, and much healthier – 
        they are at least as strong and vigorous as we are.</p>
