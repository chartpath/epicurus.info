        unwarrantably mauled and maltreated by the soul and dragged to things which are not
        necessary (in fact, the wants of the body are small and easy to obtain — and the
        soul too can live well by sharing in their enjoyment — while those of the soul are both great and difficult to obtain and,
        besides being of no benefit to our nature, actually involve dangers). So (to
        reiterate what I was saying) observing that these people are in this predicament, I bewailed their behaviour and wept over
        the wasting of their lives, and I considered it the responsibility of a good man to give
        <font color="#551A8B">benevolent </font> assistance, to the utmost of
        one's ability, to those of them who are well-constituted.&nbsp; <font color="#551A8B">This</font>

        <p align="justify"><font color="#551A8B">And I wanted to refute those who accuse natural
        science of being unable to be of any benefit to us.</font>&nbsp; In this way,
        <font color="#551A8B">citizens,</font> even though I am not engaging in public
        affairs, I say these things through the inscription just as if I were taking
        action, and in an endeavour to prove that what benefits our nature, namely freedom from
        disturbance, is identical for one and all.</p>
        <p align="justify">And so, having described the second reason for the
        inscription, I now go on to mention my mission and to explain its character and nature.</p>
        <p align="justify">Having already reached the sunset of my life (being almost on the verge of departure from the world on account of old age), I wanted, before being overtaken by
        death, to compose a <font color="#551A8B">fine</font> anthem <font color="#551A8B">to celebrate
        the</font> fullness <font color="#551A8B">of pleasure</font> and so to help now those who are
        well-constituted. Now, if only one person or two or three or four or five or six or any larger number you choose, sir, provided that it is not very large, were in a bad
        predicament, I should address them individually and do all in my power to give them the best advice. But, as I have said before, the majority of people suffer from a
        common disease, as in a plague, with their false notions about things, and their number is increasing (for in mutual emulation they catch the disease from one another, like
        sheep) moreover, <font color="#551A8B">it is</font> right to help <font color="#551A8B">also</font> generations to come (for they too belong to us, though they are still
        unborn) and, besides, love of humanity prompts us to aid also the foreigners who
        come here. Now, since the remedies of the inscription reach a larger number of people, I wished to use this stoa to advertise publicly the
        <font color="#551A8B">medicines</font> that bring salvation. These medicines we have put
        <font color="#551A8B">fully</font> to the test; for we have dispelled the fears
        <font color="#551A8B">that grip</font> us without justification, and, as for pains, those that
        are groundless we have completely excised, while those that are natural we have reduced to an absolute
        minimum, making their magnitude minute.</p>

        Abdera, he did well to identify atoms as elemental, but since his conception of them was in some respects mistaken,
        he will be considered in the exposition of our theories.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">Now we shall bring charges against the said men, not out of contentiousness towards them, but because we

        our list.</p>

        there were not a continual flow being borne from us to the mirrors and bringing

        image</font> to us. For this too is convincing proof of the effluence, seeing that each of the parts is carried to the point straight ahead.</p>
        <p align="justify"><a name="5.3.3"></a>Now the images that flow from objects, by impinging on our eyes, cause us both to see external realities
        and, <font color="#551A8B">through entering our soul, to think of them.
        So it is through impingements</font> that the soul receives in turn the things seen by the eyes; and after the
        impingements of the first images, our nature is rendered porous in such a manner that, even if the objects which it first saw are
        no longer present, images similar to the first ones are received by the mind,

        How so? When we are asleep, with all the senses as if it were paralysed and
        extinguished <font color="#551A8B">again in</font> sleep, the soul, which is

        <p align="justify"><font color="#551A8B">.</font>.. asleep ... So visions
        are not empty illusions of the mind, as the Stoics hold.&nbsp; For
        indeed, if on the one hand they call them empty on the ground that,
        while they have a corporeal nature, it is exceedingly subtle and does
        not impinge on the senses, they have expressed themselves wrongly, <font color="#551A8B">since
        it was necessary to call </font>them corporeal, despite their
        subtlety.&nbsp; If on the other hand they call them empty on the ground
        that they have no corporeal nature at all -- and it is in fact this
        rather than the former which they mean --, how can the empty be
        represented?</p>
        <p align="justify">What then are they?&nbsp; Visions in fact have a
        composition which is subtle and eludes our sight, <font color="#551A8B">but
        which is not empty.&nbsp; </font>For the mind, being superior in subtlety,
        .... provides ... the starting-point and ... things ... and moves
        ........... imagining that we shall be struck with a sword or shall fall
        from a precipice, we spring up in consequence of our fear, even when we
        are in company.&nbsp; To these examples <font color="#551A8B">I add this
        further one: since in our dreams, </font>as also when we are awake, we
        perform sexual acts, it is no good arguing that the pleasure we derive
        from them is unreal because we are asleep.&nbsp; So one must not call
        these visions empty, since they actually possess such great power.</p>
        <p align="justify">On the other hand, however, if they are not empty , that
        does not mean that they are sentient and rational and really chat to us,
        as Democritus supposes; for films which are so subtle and lack the depth
        of a solid constitution cannot possibly possess these faculties.</p>
        <p align="justify">So these theorists, the Stoics and Democritus, went
        astray in opposite directions: the Stoics deprive visions of a power
        which they <i>do</i> have, while Democritus endows them with a power which
        they do <i>not </i>have.&nbsp; In fact the nature of <font color="#551A8B">dreams</font>...</p>

        the Bear; moreover, some move in a high orbit, others however in a low
        one. Yes, and this is a fact of which most people are ignorant: they suppose
        the sun at any rate to be as low as it appears to be, whereas it is not as low; for if it
        were so, the earth and everything on it would necessarily be set ablaze. So it is its image which we see

        a seer rather than a wise man. It is correct, however, to say that, while all explanations are possible, this one
        is more plausible than that.&nbsp;</p>

        and experience pleasure afterwards, nor do we emit semen and experience

        without awaiting the future.</p>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#551A8B">As for causes that follow, an
        example is expecting</font> to win praise after death: although men
        experience pleasure now because there will be a favourable memory of

        later.</p>
        <p align="justify">Now you, being unable to mark off these distinctions,

        die. And this is not the only sign of its supremacy, but it is also the case
        that amputations of hands and often of whole arms or legs by fire and iron
        cannot unfasten life. So powerful is the dominion which the soul-part of

      fortune in the matter; for, before your letter arrived, Theodoridas of
      Lindus, a member of our school not unknown to you, who is still a novice
      in philosophy, was dealing with the same doctrine.&nbsp; And this doctrine
      came to be better articulated as a result of being turned over between the
      two of us face to face; for our agreements and disagreements with one
      another, and also our questionings, rendered the inquiry into the object
      of our search more precise.</p>
