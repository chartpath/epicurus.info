      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Atomism</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The doctrine of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">atomism,</i>
      a Greek innovation introduced by philosophers Leucippus of Miletus and
      Democritus of Abdera in the 5th century BC, describes a universe in which
      all tangible things are composed of minute indivisible particles of
      matter: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">atoms.</i><i style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </i>Epicurus subsequently developed a modified theory atomism for his
      own philosophical system, using it as a basis to tie in his
      epistemological and ethical theories.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Atoms Defined</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><a href="insights/1-1.html"><img border="0" src="insights/1-1t.gif" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="15"></a>In
      our age, the word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">atom</i> is most typically used to denote a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">periodical element</i>—a system of protons, neutrons, and electrons,
      which conjures up the image of a miniature solar system.&nbsp; These are
      not atoms in the classical sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
      was merely by linguistic accident that the elements listed on periodic
      tables became known as <i> atoms</i>—not unlike how the native Americans became
      known as <i>Indians</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For just as
      Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic and thought he had arrived at
      India, chemists in the 19th century isolated such substances as Hydrogen,
      Carbon, and Oxygen, and thought they had arrived at the ultimate building
      blocks of all existing things—but in fact, they still had a ways to go,
      as was confirmed when physicists later “split the atom” in the very
      next century.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">atoms</i>
        of the ancient philosophers are what modern particle physicists now call
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:  
normal">fundamental particles</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; Even today,</span> we do not know for sure which of the known
        particles are indeed fundamental, nor how many different types of them
        may ultimately exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">electron</i>
        could very well be a fundamental particle—to date, no one has ever
        “split the electron.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Protons</i>
        and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">neutrons</i>, by contrast, are
        definitely not fundamental particles—these larger entities turn out to
        be formed by trios of sub-particles called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">quarks</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        And what are quarks made of?</span>&nbsp; The mystery continues to
        unfold.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">However, contemporary physicists
        nearly all agree that particles of matter cannot be broken down for ever
        and ever—there must be some quantum level at which particles are
        irreducible.&nbsp; We can be assured of this because it is apparent that
        the way that matter behaves at the scale of electrons and quarks, is
        wholly different from the behavior we see on the scale of billiard balls
        or planets.<span style="mso-spacerun:  
yes">&nbsp; </span>This is because particles exhibit <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:  
normal">quantum</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">effects</i>—their
        measured qualities are limited to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">discrete
        values</i>.&nbsp; If particles were infinitely divisible, then any
        object could be scaled down to any size without being subject to such
        effects: there would be no reason for matter to group itself together
        into periodic elements, and, just as in the tales of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gulliver’s
        Travels</i>, everything we know of could exist in any size: people,
        cities, worlds, or what-have-you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
        indeed this is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not</i> the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Scale matters</i>, because
        the building blocks of all things are discrete entities of fixed sizes.</p>
      <p class="Citation" align="justify"><b>Permanence of Matter</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The atoms of Democritus and Epicurus
      were also deemed to be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">eternal,</i>
      i.e., they can neither be destroyed, nor created.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This universal law is what contemporary physicists deem the “law
      of conservation”—and it applies equally to mass and energy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">People are born young and grow old, but
      in one aspect, we are all the same age: all of the matter in our bodies is
      as old as the universe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before
      they became a part of us, each one of our “personal” atoms had been
      somewhere else: in the air we eventually breathed, the water we eventually
      drank, and the food we eventually ate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>And before then, they resided in the soil of the earth, the
      scattered dust of outer space, and even in the blazing depths of ancient
      stars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When we die, our
      bodies will be dissolved into their elements, which shall continue on
      without us to be redistributed throughout the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>The planet Earth itself will eventually break down at some
      unknown time many eons from now, and all of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">its</i>
      elements will be carried away by the exploding sun and strewn throughout
      space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From those ashes,
      new worlds may be formed as the atoms regroup.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>But the creation of anything new may only come about by the
      demolition of something previously existing: you can’t get something
      from nothing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">If matter cannot be created, how do we
      then account for the creation of the universe?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It must stand to reason that all matter that exists today has
      existed for all time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Does
      that mean forever—an infinite amount of time?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>That is indeed what the ancient Epicureans naturally assumed, but <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">it
may not be</span> necessarily so.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Properties of Space</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Matter is not the only thing that exists
      in the universe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is
      also a counterpart to matter, which the ancient atomists called the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">void</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The term is used
      to describe the emptiness of unoccupied places, a concept that we usually
      regard as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">space</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>Just because the void is essentially “nothingness,” it
      still <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">does exist</i>, as an
      intangible medium that contains and conducts the transportation of matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>If only matter existed without the accompaniment of void, the
      atomists reasoned, then nothing could ever move, because the entire
      universe would be packed absolutely tight with matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>But the void is a perfect superconductor, utterly passive,
      presenting no friction whatsoever to the atoms which pass through it.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Matter and void are the fundamental
      constituents of all existence, and the Epicureans asserted that no third constituent is possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>If something is tangible to any degree, then it contains
      material—what dif not, then it is merely spatial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>All the phenomena that we know of, or that we attempt to discover,
      or that we care to speculate about, can and must be accounted for in terms
      of indivisible bodies moving through empty space.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Besides intangibility, another essential
      property of the void is its <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">boundlessness</i>,
      meaning that it is not delineated by any boundaries, edges, or
      extremities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Does this mean
      that the reaches of space extend forever and that the universe is
      infinitely large?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      Epicureans thought so</span>, for if there was indeed an “end of the
      universe,” what would happen, as Lucretius supposed, if someone <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">went
      there</i> and threw a spear beyond the point where he was?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>One of two things would happen: either the spear would proceed
      onwards, or something would get in its way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In either case there would have to be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">something</i>
      beyond that point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In neither
      case has one arrived at the end of the universe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This type of persuasive reasoning carried on for ages, and was
      believed by most every scientific thinker, including the young Albert
      Einstein.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>Modern Cosmological Considerations</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">However, once Einstein had developed the
      principles of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">general relativity</i>
      in 1915, the way had been paved for a new possibility: a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">boundless
      yet finite</i> universe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
      makes this arrangement possible is that the “void” has yet another
      attribute, unimagined by the ancients, which is: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shape</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Gravity, according to General Relativity, is an effect of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">curved</i>
      space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If space can be
      curved, then the dimensions of the universe could very well be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">circular</i>,
      not unlike the dimensions of the Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The analogy is an apt one, because it’s easy for anyone today to
      realize that the Earth’s surface has no “ends,” but is a continuous
      plane wrapped upon itself—and in spite of having no such boundaries, the
      Earth’s surface is definitely <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not</i>
      infinite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We can imagine what
      would happen if Lucretius departed from Rome to throw his spear off the
      “edge of the Earth”—in his quest to find it, he would march and sail
      along a straight path, unwittingly circumnavigating the entire planet, and
      winding up right back where he started from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This would happen no matter what direction he traveled: east,
      north, southwest, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; H</span>e
      might be driven to conclude that “all roads lead to Rome” indeed!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Although it is much more difficult to
      visualize, the same principle can be applied to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">three-dimensional</i>
      space curved upon itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
      implies that a hypothetical expedition across the universe in any
      particular direction would always lead the imaginary space traveler back
      to where he started—regardless of his direction of travel.&nbsp;
      However, we should not expect such a bold voyage to succeed, because it is
      now believed that the universe is <i>expanding</i> faster than any
      spaceship could ever travel.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This most revolutionary discovery came
      in 1929, at the Mt. Wilson Observatory in California, where astronomer
      Edwin Hubble measured and cataloged the distances of galaxies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>As he compiled his data, he found a general correlation between
      distance and space motion: the further away a galaxy was, the faster it receded from Earth
(and consequently: from all the other galaxies too).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The immediate implication of this observation was that the universe
      was spreading itself thin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So if matter
      disperses itself over time, an even more profound implication follows: the
      further back you trace the history of the universe, the denser the
      universe must have been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trace
      back far enough, somewhere between 12 and 20 billion years ago, and
      you’ll have reached a point of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">infinite</i>
      density.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The entire universe
      was then contained within the space of a pinprick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>From this infinitesimal spot came pouring forth all the matter that
      exists, in a violent expulsion that echoes down to the present day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">big bang</i> theory was
      born.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Relativity, curved space, and the Big
      Bang may seem far removed from the humble cosmology of an ancient Greek
      like Epicurus, but this modern framework will provide us with a novel
      means of substantiating one of Epicurus’ most controversial conjectures:
      <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">the atomic swerve</i>.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b>The Atomic Swerve</b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In the atomic system of Democritus,
      cosmology is entirely <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">deterministic</i>,
      meaning that everything that happens in the universe is the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">inevitable
      </i>consequence of what happened before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>According to this view, the trajectory of each and every atom
      proceeding along straight-line paths that are solely altered by inevitable
      collisions with other atoms throughout the course of history—all events,
      past, present, and future, including the fact that you exist and are
      reading this sentence right now, are dictated by fate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Epicurus, contrarily, proposed that as atoms traverse the void,
      they may deviate from a straight-line path at “uncertain times and
      places.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These random
      deviations are very slight, and they occur without any connection to the
      behavior of other atoms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
      philosophical terms, Epicurus takes on the position of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">indeterminism,</i>
      meaning that whatever happens in the universe is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal">incidental</i>, rather than inevitable.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Contemporary physicists still disagree
      as to whether matter behaves in a fundamentally deterministic or
      indeterministic manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      1927 discovery of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">uncertainty
      principle</i>, by Werner Heisenberg, has been a prominent catalyst for
      this debate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dilemma
      which the principle presents, is that it is impossible to ascertain <i> both</i>
      the<i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">position and momentum</i>  </i> of any
      particle with precision—the more accurate determination of the one must
      entail a less precise measurement of the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Because of this inherent imprecision, a degree of
      “indeterminism” must be factored into predictions, within certain
      limits of probability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
      when we speak of “indeterminism” in its full philosophical sense, we
      are talking about a stronger meaning: random deviations that are<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: 
normal"> axiomatic</i>—a fundamental property of matter itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Now because there are limits to what can be measured, as Heisenberg
      discovered, all this implies is that we can’t make assertions about
      the events operating beyond those limits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>So the uncertainly principle does not substantiate either side of
      the argument.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Epicurus’ criticism of Democritus’
      determinism, however, stems from a much more blatant observation—an
      observation as large as the universe itself: if elements never deviated from
      straight-line paths through the void, how would they have ever found an
      occasion to collide in the first place?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why
      wouldn’t the atoms just rain down in parallel paths forever?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This is exactly the same issue that cosmologists are struggling
      with today in attempting to describe the early history of the universe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>They want to know how it came about that nature abounds with
      groupings of galaxies, stars, and planets, rather than an evenly distributed atomic
      fog.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><a href="insights/1-11.html"><img border="0" src="insights/1-11t.gif" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="15"></a>In
      1992, an exciting experiment was undertaken to investigate how the
      universe evolved the structure it has today: the COBE satellite project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The microwave detectors onboard this craft mapped the cosmic
      background radiation which appears at the “edge” of the visible
      universe in every direction we look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>What we are actually seeing there is the light given off by the
      receding plasma which constituted the dense early universe (now arriving
      as microwave energy due to wavelength elongation caused by the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Doppler
      effect</i>). The resulting map depicted minute temperature variances
      distributed chaotically—regions of higher temperatures signifying areas
      of higher density.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The areas
      of higher density would later form the complex structures of galactic
      clusters that we see today, while the pockets of lower density would
      become rapidly dispersed in intergalactic space.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The great scientific/philosophic
      question surrounding these findings is: what would account for these
      variances?<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><a href="insights/1-12.html"><img border="0" src="insights/1-12t.gif" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="15"></a></span>If,
      at the initial state of the universe, all matter was packed into a
      geometric point, then the initial condition of the universe started was a
      symmetrical, homogenous arrangement—it makes no
      sense, after all, to speak of a “lop-sided” zero-dimensional point!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>But if the evenly spaced atoms of the early universe were to have
      fanned out in parallel rays, powdering space with equal atomic density,
      the variances in temperature that we see in the COBE images could not
      exist—and neither would the galaxies, worlds, nor us!</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Hence, the Epicurean theory of the
      “atomic swerve” provides an accounting for that
      “initial lateral motion”
      which made subsequent atomic collisions possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It is therefore reasonable to assume that atoms are still
      “swerving” today.</p>
