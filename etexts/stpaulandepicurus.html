        <b><font face="Arial" size="4">PREFACE</font></b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4">T</font><font size="1">HE</font> present study is a sequel
        to the author's <i>Epicurus and His Philosophy</i> and it aims at making
        good the thesis there enunciated that Epicureanism functioned as a
        bridge of transition from Greek philosophy to the Christian religion. It
        is hoped by this means to have opened up a new window on the New
        Testament, a window walled up by prejudice long centuries ago.</p>
        <p align="justify">This prejudice had its root in exasperation over the
        theology of Epicurus, which repudiated belief in miracles, prophecy,
        divine providence, and immortality. Epicurus was consequently denounced
        as an atheist, which he was not.</p>
        <p align="justify">Joined with this exasperating theology was an
        alluring body of ethical doctrine, neatly organized and attractively
        presented. Unluckily, however, part of the lure of the ethic consisted
        in analyzing happiness to consist of the memory of pleasures past, the
        enjoyment of pleasures present, and the hope of pleasures to come. This
        espousal of pleasure as the chief good of life gave excuse for
        denouncing Epicurus as a sensualist, which he was not. His pleasures
        were not the pleasures of the flesh.</p>
        <p align="justify">Nevertheless the merit of this ethic was so superior
        and so widely acknowledged that Paul had no alternative but to adopt it
        and bless it with the new sanction of religion, though to admit his
        indebtedness to the alleged atheist and sensualist was inconceivable.
        Epicurus was consequently consigned to anonymity.</p>
        <p align="justify">When once this screen of anonymity has been
        penetrated, we shall find that the most beloved devotional readings in
        the Epistles of Paul exhibit the greatest influence of the friendly
        Epicurus. An example is the illustrious hymn to love in First
        Corinthians 13. The philosophy of love or friendship had created a
        climate of feeling favorable to the acceptance of the religion of love.
        Epicurus had also established a cult of peace, whether peace of mind or
        peace among men, long before Paul preached &quot;the gospel of
        peace&quot; and &quot;the God of peace.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus had set the fashion for expounding doctrine
        in the form of an epistle. One of these writings bore the title <i>To
        the Friends in Asia</i> and was in circulation for three centuries
        before Paul composed his Epistle with the inscription <i>To the Saints
        Which Are in Ephesus</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify">Long before the congregations organized by Paul began
        to assemble in private houses to perpetuate the memory of Jesus the
        Christ, innumerable colonies of the disciples of Epicurus had been
        accustomed to meet in private houses to perpetuate the memory of their
        founder, whom they revered as the discoverer of truth and a savior.
        Epicurus, according to the records, had so ordered it, just as we are
        informed that Jesus did.</p>
        <p align="justify">The ability to follow the trail of these hidden
        parallelisms and to spot the unacknowledged adaptations of Epicurean
        teachings in the writings of Paul is the sole advantage to be claimed by
        the author of this study over other scholars. The process of detection,
        when once the clues have been identified, will not be difficult; one
        discovery will ease the way to another and in the end the total number
        of appropriated teachings may prove to be astonishing.</p>
        <p align="justify">Among the immediate rewards will be more precise
        translations and occasionally for the first time correct translations.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was the first intention of the author to entitle
        this study <i>Epicurus and the New Testament</i> but it speedily became
        apparent that the Pauline writings called for treatment apart from the
        Gospels.</p>
        <p align="justify">The division into chapters under the names of the
        Epistles has resulted in a moderate amount of repetition, for which no
        apology seems necessary. The objective has been discovery and
        instruction, not entertainment.</p>
        <p align="justify">As a last word the author disavows all claim to have
        made a definitive investigation. He will be content with the hope of
        having made a definite breach in the ancient wall of prejudice and
        anonymity. To the work yet to be done in this line of research there is
        no near limit.</p>
        <p align="justify">This limit is the farther removed for several
        reasons. The treatment accorded to Epicurus in histories of philosophy
        is perfunctory and marred at its best by the inveterate omissions,
        errors, and prejudices. As for the source materials, even good
        university libraries may be ill supplied with them; certain items have
        been long out of print; others have never been translated; many are
        fragmentary and yield their data only to a diligent and practiced
        scholar. Even a willing and competent researcher would do well after a
        year's study to feel capable of handling his sources with facility.</p>
        <p align="justify">The human factor must also be reckoned with; the
        philosophy of Epicurus was animated by a characteristic spirit, genial
        and reasonable and yet resolute, and to capture this spirit will demand
        a change of attitude, which is not to be accomplished overnight.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the present study all questions of scholarship
        concerning the authenticity of certain Epistles have been ignored as
        unessential to the problem of Epicurean influence. In general the
        endeavor has been made to hold the exposition at the level of the
        educated layman, for whom the source material would neither be available
        nor usable. Those readers who will find profit in footnotes are referred
        to the preceding volume, <i>Epicurus and His Philosophy</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thanks are due to a former pupil, Miss E. Marguerite
        Baker, who generously volunteered to help in the preparation of the
        manuscript; to a capable colleague, Dr. W. E. Staples, who gave advice
        on Hebrew thought and literature; and to Professor Arthur Stanley Pease
        of Harvard University, whose candid criticisms on matters of
        Epicureanism have always merited respect.</p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4">E</font><font size="2">PICURUS</font>, although an Athenian
        citizen by birth, was neither born nor raised in Athens but on the
        island of Samos not far from Ephesus. The fact is significant: he grew
        up entirely free from the political obsession that plagued the Athenians
        of Athens. He favored a minimum of government control and a maximum of
        individual freedom, while Plato, an Athenian of Athens, fathered the
        highly regimented state with a minimum of individual freedom and a
        maximum of government control.</p>
        <p align="justify">These two ideals are still competitors in our modern
        world. The open type of society which was sponsored by Epicurus has
        allied itself with Christianity. The closed type of society which was
        sponsored by Plato has taken its stand against religion.</p>
        <p align="justify">The year of Epicurus' birth was 341 B.C. This date
        will take on significance if it be recalled that Plato was then seven
        years in his grave and only seven years were to elapse before Alexander
        should set out on his momentous career of conquest. Thus the lifetime of
        Epicurus fell squarely in the interval of transition between the
        localized and introvert culture of ancient Greece and the cosmopolitan
        and extrovert culture of the so-called Hellenistic age.</p>
        <p align="justify">In respect of social class Epicurus belonged to the
        educated poor; his father was a schoolmaster. This too is significant;
        it placed a social discount upon his philosophy, because schoolmasters
        enjoyed little esteem in the ancient world, even among the cultured
        Greeks. Intellectual aristocrats, including those who aspired to be
        thought of this class, preferred Platonism. Cicero once wrote in a
        snobbish mood: &quot;I would prefer to agree with Plato and be wrong
        rather than to agree with Epicurus and be right.&quot; Epicureanism was
        destined to flourish best among the thrifty and intelligent middle
        classes, the same levels of society to which Paul addressed his message.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        Education</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">An incident that has been recorded from the school
        days of Epicurus informs us of his precocity and his independent spirit.
        The teacher was dictating a line of poetry that ran, &quot;Verily first
        of all chaos was created,&quot; whereupon the boy interrupted to ask
        &quot;out of what chaos was created.&quot; The teacher lost his temper,
        said it was no business of his to know the answer, and told him to go to
        the philosophers. &quot;Well,&quot; said Epicurus in effect, &quot;that
        is what I shall do.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Additional interest attaches to the incident because
        in the mature philosophy of Epicurus the existence of chaos was denied.
        According to him the universe was eternal and had always been an orderly
        cosmos; all stories of divine creation were myths. In due time his
        disciples were to make fun of the Book of Genesis.</p>
        <p align="justify">At the age of eighteen Epicurus was summoned to
        perform the required two years of military training in Athens, and the
        call chanced to coincide with the news of the untimely death of
        Alexander in 323 B.C. A rash war was immediately begun by the elated
        Athenians, which quickly ended in catastrophe; and so Epicurus became,
        as it were, an eyewitness of the last scene of the last act of the
        realistic drama that marked the transition from local democracy to world
        empire. The offending orators were executed by the Macedonians. This
        experience was not without its influence upon the youthful Epicurus, who
        subsequently condemned the political career and the whole program of
        education that prepared for it. His nonpolitical philosophy flourished
        in advance of nonpolitical Christianity.</p>
        <p align="justify">This condemnation of the higher education placed
        Epicurus in the same position as St. Paul at Ephesus in later days, when
        he threatened the emolument of the silversmiths; vested interests were
        at stake. The rhetoricians, who depended upon students' fees, retorted
        madly by denouncing him as a dullard, an ignoramus, and an enemy of all
        culture.</p>
        <p align="justify">These slanders continued to flourish throughout
        ancient times and are still repeated and believed by acquiescent modern
        scholars but refutation is not difficult. In reality Epicurus was an
        acute reasoner and in his youth he had made the round of the schools
        then flourishing.</p>
        <p align="justify">Before his cadetship he was enrolled in Samos with
        Pamphilus the Platonist, probably for the usual four years, from the age
        of fourteen to eighteen. After his cadetship he studied with a capable
        Peripatetic, Praxiphanes of Rhodes, who was more interested in good
        writing than in oratorical rhetoric. Third and last on the list of able
        teachers was Nausiphanes of Teos, a shrewd and learned, though indolent,
        man, who perpetuated the teachings of Democritus, the atomist.</p>
        <p align="justify">From this teacher Nausiphanes Epicurus parted in
        consequence of a violent quarrel, and it is probable that he had
        bickered with the previous two. He afterward denied all debt to any of
        them and boasted of being &quot;self-taught.&quot; This boast bears a
        singular resemblance to the declaration of Paul to the Galatians: But I
        certify you, brethren, that the gospel that was preached of me is not
        after man; for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it.</p>
        <p align="justify">The comparison ends itself abruptly, however, because
        Epicurus did not claim divine inspiration. He regarded himself as the
        originator of truth and his disciples so esteemed him. In his writings
        he never quoted authorities; his utterances were offered as oracles. He
        referred to his doctrines as &quot;true philosophy&quot; and his
        disciples lauded him as a god and the sole discoverer of truth. After
        the savior sentiment became popular they also spoke of him as a savior.</p>
        <p align="justify">The consciousness of a mission to bring happiness to
        mankind seems to have come to him while studying with Nausiphanes. At
        any rate he gave up all hope of arriving at wisdom by the help of
        teachers and resumed his residence with his parents and three brothers
        at Colophon. This was a small but ancient city a few miles north of
        Ephesus and deserves to be regarded with some distinction. It was there
        during the ensuing years that Epicurus worked out his system of thought
        to completion. This was the only world philosophy and the only
        missionary philosophy produced by the Greeks and was destined to
        flourish openly for seven centuries, three before Christ and four
        afterward. Even in modern times its influence operates anonymously.</p>

        of Epicurus certain paradoxical facts should be brought to attention and
        stored in mind. Of all Greek philosophers Epicurus is the only one who
        in point of appearance and demeanor would suggest the person of Christ.
        His bearded face, which is well known from surviving portrait busts,
        exhibits a quiet dignity and serenity of mien so suggestive of the
        popular concept of the countenance of Jesus as to be frequently remarked
        by the most disinterested observers. In ancient times this kindly face
        was universally known because of statues in public places and not less
        because of likenesses set into the finger rings of his followers. In
        Paul's own lifetime the reverence with which it was regarded provoked
        the scorn of the elder Pliny in Rome and at a later time the disgust of
        the churchman Origen in the East.</p>
        <p align="justify">In harmony with this portraiture is the estimation of
        his personality as handed down in the tradition of his own school:
        &quot;A truly sacred character and divinely gifted, the only man who has
        arrived at a knowledge of the true and the beautiful and has transmitted
        this knowledge to others, and the only man who has brought freedom to
        his followers.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In harmony with both portraiture and personality is
        the plan of life he recommended, a simple, unambitious way of living,
        far from the ignoble quest of wealth, power, and fame, characterized by
        courtesy combined with absolute veracity, good will to mankind,
        considerateness, loyalty to friends, benevolence, gratitude for past
        blessings, hope for the future, and in time of trouble patience.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet this threefold harmony of portraiture,
        personality, and attitudes<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        the appearance, character, and teachings of Jesus<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>– </span>must prompt us
        chiefly to realize the embarrassing predicament of Paul. The basis of
        reasoning upon which this plan of life was constructed could only be to
        him as horrifying as the practical precepts of the life were attractive.
        The plan was made to depend upon emancipation from the yoke of religion
        and the fear of death and divine wrath.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet this opposition of doctrine was only one aspect
        of the historical paradox. The more momentous aspect of it lay in the
        fact that the whole coherent structure of Epicurean materialism had been
        built up and solidified and disseminated over the Mediterranean world
        during the three centuries before the birth of Christ. It was
        consequently a necessity for Jesus and Paul to build up a substitute
        structure of thought in opposition to a system firmly and widely
        established and amply equipped in advance to oppose it and to criticize
        it.</p>
        <p align="justify">All the armament of Epicurean logic which had been
        developed to combat Greek paganism and Platonic idealism was available
        from the outset for the crusade against the nascent Christianity. This
        conflict fell chiefly upon Paul, because it was his lot to carry the new
        gospel to the Greeks. For him the specific task was to build up a new
        structure of spirituality in the face of an entrenched and confident
        structure of materialism. It was the logic of the cross against the
        logic of the atom, an early phase of the long strife between science and
        religion. Epicurus himself became a sort of Antichrist.</p>

        Peace and Safety</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus, like Jesus, began his ministry, if one may
        so write, about the age of thirty, and it may be added that he exhibited
        an aggressiveness comparable to that of Jesus in cleansing the temple.
        For his first venture as a public teacher his choice fell upon Mytilene,
        a thriving city on the island of Lesbos. There he quickly exasperated
        the local philosophers, who were Platonists, by denouncing their whole
        program of education, and especially rhetoric, which was in high demand
        as preparing young men for a public career and for this reason jealously
        guarded as the money-making branch of the curriculum.</p>
        <p align="justify">These enemies retaliated by accusing Epicurus of
        impiety, which was treason under Greek law and punishable by death; they
        prodded the civil authorities into action and incited the rabble against
        him. So vicious became the threat to his life that the sole way of
        escape was flight by ship in wintry seas.</p>
        <p align="justify">By good luck he arrived safely at the refuge of his
        choice, the city of Lampsacus on the Hellespont, now the Dardanelles;
        but on the way he was in danger of death by exposure or of capture by
        pirates, and he narrowly escaped shipwreck. This painful experience was
        taken to heart. Never again did he invite persecution.</p>
        <p align="justify">Instead he took the determination to confine himself
        to peaceful methods and even prescribed rules of safety for his
        followers in his Authorized Doctrines. Thus the words Peace and Safety
        became catchwords of his sect and unless we are aware of this fact we
        shall fail to recognize the meaning of Paul in First Thessalonians 5:3:
        &quot;For when they shall say Peace and Safety, then sudden destruction
        cometh upon them.&quot; This version, however, leaves something to be
        desired; it would be more accurate to read: &quot;For at the very time
        that the words Peace and Safety are on their lips, sudden destruction is
        hanging over them.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In Lampsacus, although destitute and a refugee,
        Epicurus received protection and speedily made powerful friends among
        the officials of the local court, and in particular won the friendship
        of one Idomeneus, a scholarly and affluent man, who continued to furnish
        him generous financial support throughout the rest of his long life. It
        was there also that he gathered about him a group of able disciples,
        especially three: Hermarchus, who had followed him from Mytilene, and
        Metrodorus and Polyaenus.</p>
        <p align="justify">These men were to him what Timothy, Titus, and Luke
        were to Paul at a later time. Moreover, just as Paul numbered women
        among his workers, such as Priscilla, so Epicurus had one Themista, a
        talented woman of Lampsacus, who wrote a book long famous on the Vanity
        of Glory. This may have been in the hands of Ecclesiastes when he wrote,
        &quot;Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,&quot; and it is certain that
        Cicero mentioned it in a speech before the Roman senate.</p>
        <p align="justify">After four years of happy residence in Lampsacus
        Epicurus was advised to leave it for the same reason that had brought
        him there in the beginning, considerations of safety; war seemed to be
        imminent between the Macedonian kings of Asia. His choice fell upon
        Athens, the best location for the dissemination of a new philosophy.</p>
        <p align="justify">Even there, however, he did not dare to offer himself
        as a public teacher. Such a venture would have brought him under the
        jurisdiction of the superintendent of education, known as the
        gymnasiarch, and the spirit of persecution was then abroad. Only the
        year before his arrival, which occurred in 306 B.C., a law had been
        passed imposing the penalty of death for any philosopher who should
        offer himself as a public teacher without a license from the governing
        bodies. The law was repealed within the year but Epicurus was taking no
        chances; he confined his instruction to his own house within the city
        walls and to a garden outside.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was no part of his plan to educate the Athenians.
        Already he had staked his claims in larger spheres of influence. His
        biographer writes that &quot;friends came from all parts and shared the
        life with him in the Garden,&quot; this being the name by which the
        school became popularly known. From the outset it was planned that every
        alumnus should become a missionary. The method was essentially
        &quot;each one teach one.&quot; All were supplied with textbooks
        specially written for home study and group instruction.</p>
        <p align="justify">The bond of union among members of the sect in all
        parts was friendship. They called themselves &quot;Friends of
        Epicurus.&quot; It was for this reason that Paul sedulously avoids the
        words <i>friend</i> and <i>friendship;</i> they occur nowhere in his
        writings, although not infrequent elsewhere in the New Testament.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        Doctrines</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">While recognizing Epicurus as a venturesome innovator
        in ethics and education we must also bear in mind that no thinker,
        however rebellious, can escape the succession of thinkers and the
        tradition of culture into which he was born. Each individual is bound to
        adopt as much as he rejects. Epicurus, for instance, rejected the study
        of geometry as having no bearing on the practical life but he discerned
        the merit of the textbook style of writing that was perfected in that
        field by his contemporary Euclid. He recognized this unadorned way of
        writing as being specially adapted for the instruction of the multitudes
        whom he aspired to win over to his version of the happy life. He knew
        how to write artfully and was inclined toward the poetical, but he
        suppressed both of these tendencies in the interest of clarity, which he
        declared to be the sole requisite of style.</p>
        <p align="justify">In pursuing this course he performed an unwitting
        service to Christianity by habituating the ancient public to the
        practice of reading plainly written textbooks on ethical subjects. He
        prepared the ground for Paul, in particular, who, like himself, felt the
        need of keeping in check the tendencies toward the rhetorical and the
        poetical.</p>
        <p align="justify">In his textbooks Epicurus embodied the most neat and
        orderly system of knowledge ever put together in ancient times. It
        consisted of three parts, Canon, Physics, and Ethics, all of them known
        to Paul, as is revealed by specific references, if only we have learned
        to recognize the clues. Paul revealed his knowledge of the Canon by
        setting up a canon of his own; he recognized the Physics by postulating
        a different source of truth. He recognized the Ethics by adopting many
        of its teachings, changing the motivation.</p>
        <p align="justify">By the canon was meant the criteria by which the
        truth was to be tested. These criteria or tests were three in number:
        Sensations, Feelings, and Anticipations, all of them furnished by Nature
        herself. To Epicurus Nature was the supreme teacher and Paul betrays his
        knowledge of this fact in First Corinthians 11:14 by writing: &quot;Does
        not Nature herself teach you?&quot; It also comes quite naturally to him
        to write &quot;according to nature&quot; and &quot;contrary to
        nature.&quot; The more significance attaches to this because nowhere in
        the New Testament does the word nature occur except in the Epistles of
        Paul himself and those of Peter and James.</p>
        <p align="justify">That the Canon of Epicurus was known to Paul is
        demonstrated by First Corinthians 2, where he lucidly sets up his
        substitute, which is spiritual insight, not an endowment of Nature, but
        the gift of God. As for the Physics, Epicurus deduced from this his
        whole system of ethics and Paul reveals both his awareness of this and
        his reaction to it by the vehemence with which he insists that &quot;all
        the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&quot; are hidden in God. A
        positive assertion of this kind presumes a negative and this negative is
        assuredly Epicurean. Epicurus had virtually taught that all the
        treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Nature.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Sensations are five, corresponding to the five
        senses. According to Epicurus these are man's direct contact with
        physical realities. He thinks of the mind as an automatic mechanism for
        processing the data of the senses and points out what a marvellous job
        they do of taking care of us on our daily rounds and keeping us from
        tripping over sleeping dogs or falling into ditches. He never claims
        infallibility for the sensations, as modern scholars wrongly assert.
        Only immediate sensations are to be trusted. For example, if the
        observer sees a man face to face he can be sure whether it is Plato; at
        the distance of half a mile he cannot be sure whether it is Plato or
        Aristotle. Only the faceto-face recognition is sure.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul's reaction to this is highly interesting; he
        rejects it in theory and adopts it in practice. For example, he employs
        the terminology of sensation in one of his finest verses, First
        Corinthians 13:12: &quot;For now we see in a mirror, indistinctly, but
        then face to face.&quot; On the contrary, in Colossians 2:18 he pours
        scorn on the unnamed Epicurean, &quot;taking his stand on what he has
        seen, puffed up without justification by the mind of the flesh&quot;
        (the translation is our own). Much of importance awaits to be said on
        this topic in Chapter IX.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Feelings are two, pleasure and pain, Nature's
        educators, her Go and Stop signals, by which she trains man and beast to
        recognize what is good for him and what is evil in his environment. As
        criteria of truth the Feelings operate on both physical and social
        levels of life.</p>
        <p align="justify">For example, justice gives pleasure and injustice
        hurts no less than a blow or a burn. What is meant by an Anticipation
        or, as Epicurus calls it, a Prolepsis, is not difficult to explain,
        though generally misunderstood. Epicurus believed that man is
        preconditioned by Nature for living in his physical and social
        environment. On the physical level he is equipped in advance by
        Sensations and Feelings. On the level of social and intellectual life he
        is equipped with innate ideas, such as that of justice, which exist in
        advance of experience and so anticipate experience, being for that
        reason called Anticipations. He thought of the mentality of the grown
        man as being anticipated in the newborn infant just as the whole
        physical body is anticipated in the embryo before birth. He even
        insisted that man is born with an innate notion of the divine nature,
        but only as &quot;blissful and incorruptible,&quot; not wrathful. In
        spite of this fact his usual reputation was that of an atheist.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        Physics&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"></b>Under the term physics the Greeks included all
        natural science, the division into various branches such as chemistry
        and biology being destined to await the modern era. Epicurus chose to
        sponsor the atomic theory of the constitution of matter, whether animal
        or mineral. The term atom signified the minimum self-existing particle
        of matter. The word itself means &quot;indivisible&quot; and in order to
        express this idea in Latin the Romans coined the word <i>individuus,</i>
        from which we have the word &quot;individual.&quot;&nbsp; The whole
        theory of physics was reduced by Epicurus to Twelve Elementary
        Principles and a syllabus bearing this title was published for the use
        of his disciples. This list of Principles, it may be interposed, was the
        most lucid and orderly ever drawn up in ancient times, and with one
        exception would have been received with respect down to the date of an
        event so recent as the fission of the atom. By way of illustration the
        first seven are here listed with some adaptation to modern terminology:</p>

        <p align="justify">As was bound to happen, this whole system became
        known to the enemies of Epicurus by that particular Principle which was
        most offensive and provocative of ridicule, the third. This was
        offensive because it implied that the soul of man itself was composed of
        atoms, just as the body itself, and therefore subject to dissolution,
        just as the body. It was especially open to ridicule because the atoms
        were such insignificant things upon which to base a whole system of
        knowledge. In Galatians 4:9 Paul sneered at them as &quot;the weak and
        beggarly elements.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">For the reason that the atom was the smallest thing
        imaginable the word was also used of time and in First Corinthians 15:52
        it is translated &quot;in a moment&quot; and this is amplified as
        &quot;in the twinkling of an eye,&quot; referring to the miracle of the
        general resurrection. This is the sole occurrence of the word in the
        Bible.</p>
        <p align="justify">For the reason that all existing things were thought
        to be made of atoms, just as all words are made of letters, it was usual
        also to denote the atoms by the word elements, which properly means
        letters of the alphabet. The etymology of this word elements is curious
        and enlightening. The names of the letters seem to have come to us
        through the Romans from the Etruscans, who for some reason began with L
        M N, that is, el em en, hence Latin elementa, instead of beginning with
        A B C.</p>
        <p align="justify">Under the name of elements the atoms are mentioned
        six times in the New Testament, three times simply as elements and three
        times as &quot;elements of the universe,&quot; an unmistakable
        recognition of the third Elementary Principle of Epicurus: &quot;The
        universe consists of atoms and space.&quot; In the light of the fact
        that Epicurus asserted the atoms to be indestructible it is especially
        interesting to read the defiant prediction in Second Peter 3:10 and 12:
        &quot;the elements will be dissolved with fire&quot; and &quot;the
        elements will melt with fire.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The translators of 1611 were quite at a loss in
        interpreting these verses and the authors of the Revised Standard, not
        suspecting the influence of Epicurus, resorted to a farfetched
        explanation based upon belief in tutelary spirits of the universe; but
        there is no real justification for inserting the word spirits, as in
        Colossians 2:8 and 20, &quot;the elemental spirits of the
        universe.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        The Universe</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">As for the universe itself, Epicurus asserted in
        various writings, including his list of Elementary Principles, that it
        was infinite in extent. On this assumption, he was bound to believe also
        in an infinite number of worlds, more or less like our own earth; if
        there were only one world, the universe would not be infinite. Paul, of
        course, believed in a finite universe, consisting of heaven and earth,
        which God had created and would also destroy and rebuild. This idea of
        divine creation was, of course, ridiculed by Epicurus; he declared that
        &quot;the universe was the same as it always had been and always would
        be the same,&quot; and this very declaration is placed in the mouths of
        &quot;scoffers,&quot; though not precisely quoted, in Second Peter 3:4.</p>
        <p align="justify">A curious detail is worthy of mention here. According
        to Epicurus, the one thing that never changed was the atom; it was
        eternal. However, the word he employs for &quot;eternal&quot; is not the
        word used repeatedly in the New Testament in this sense; but when Paul
        in Romans 1:20 writes of &quot;the eternal power&quot; of God, it is the
        uncommon word of Epicurus that he employs, which occurs elsewhere only
        in a similar context in Jude 6. It might seem as if Paul were gently
        twitting the Epicurean reader of his day. He certainly exhibits a
        familiarity with the Epicurean vocabulary which will not bear our
        neglect.</p>
        <p align="justify">To return to our topic, the universe: in spite of
        divergence of opinion on the point of its extent, there was one detail
        in respect of which Epicurus and Paul agreed to differ with their
        respective races and agree with one another, the abolition of Hell. The
        Greeks knew this institution under the name of Acheron or Hades, the
        Jews as Gehenna or Sheoul. Both races thought of the world as divided
        into three regions: one above, one below, and another in between. Both
        Epicurus and Paul recognized but two regions, though for different
        reasons.</p>
        <p align="justify">According to Epicurus the gods were incapable of
        wrath and consequently indifferent toward wickedness. According to Paul,
        God was capable of wrath but deliberately turned his back upon the
        wicked and abandoned them to their sins unless they chose to recognize
        the resurrected Christ. They were not punished but doomed to instant
        annihilation on the last day; &quot;the wages of sin is death.&quot; Of
        temporal punishment there was none and consequently no need of Hell.</p>
        <p align="justify">Just as Epicurus and Paul were in unison in
        abolishing a realm of punishment, so they were agreed upon regarding the
        resultant universe as two regions, the earthly and the heavenly. Yet
        there is a sharp limit to this agreement. It was the teaching of
        Epicurus that the abode of the gods was located in the spaces between
        the worlds, regions of peace and perpetual light. This coincides fairly
        well, of course, with Paul's conception of heaven; but the subsidiary
        teaching of Epicurus that these gods were totally indifferent to human
        wickedness was abhorrent.</p>
        <p align="justify">His vehement reaction to this shocking doctrine may
        be found in Ephesians 6:12, where we read in the Revised Standard of
        &quot;the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.&quot; A
        more detailed interpretation of this verse, however, must await its turn
        in Chapter VI.</p>

        Ethics</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Of the ethics of Epicurus it may be said that in
        antiquity no other design for living was judged to be more alluring. His
        teachings were compared to the voices of the Sirens, those mythical
        maidens whose sweetness of voice was said to cast an irresistible spell.
        In the Rome of Cicero's day the foremost teacher of the creed was given
        the name of Siro, that is, the man who lured men like a Siren.</p>
        <p align="justify">The testimony of the illustrious churchman St.
        Augustine confirms the judgment of the pagans; he characterized the
        creed by three alluring words: Pleasure, Suavity, and Peace.</p>
        <p align="justify">The word pleasure was merely an unfortunate choice of
        terms for happiness. The truth of this statement is made clear by a
        saying of Epicurus himself: &quot;Even on the rack the wise man is
        happy.&quot; Under torture the wise man could not affirm that he was
        enjoying pleasure; but, like the Christian martyr of later times, he
        could still lay claim to happiness. The pleasure of Epicurus was not the
        pleasure of the flesh, though his enemies willfully chose to thus
        misconstrue it.</p>
        <p align="justify">Happiness in his view of things consisted in the
        memory of pleasures past, the enjoyment of pleasures present, and the
        hope of pleasures to come. This teaching was summed up in a famous
        saying: &quot;Pleasure is the beginning and the end of the happy
        life.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Plato had committed himself to the doctrine that
        continuous pleasure was impossible. Epicurus wrote to one of his young
        disciples: &quot;It is to continuous pleasures that I invite you.&quot;
        This invitation was matched by Paul, who wrote in Philippians 4:4:
        &quot;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Fullness was elevated to the rank of an alluring word
        in the language of Epicurus. In order to reconcile mankind to the
        surrender of belief in immortality he argued that fullness of pleasure
        could be attained in this mortal life, because the list of pleasures is
        limited and all natural desires for pleasure can be satisfied. With
        pleasure, of course, Paul could have no commerce and he studiously
        avoids the very name of it, but the idea of fullness was alluring, and
        so, in the compass of a single Epistle, that to the Ephesians, we find
        mention of &quot;the fullness of him who fills all in all,&quot;
        &quot;the fullness of God,&quot; and &quot;the measure of the stature of
        the fullness of Christ.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The blessed idea of fullness as a goal and
        consummation of living has been retained but the content of meaning has
        been utterly transformed; the word has been lifted bodily out of one
        context of thought and incorporated into another.</p>
        <p align="justify">Freedom is bound to be an attractive word in all
        ages. Epicurus held out this lure to the world of his day. By him it was
        defined as freedom from fears: from fear of fate, fear of the calamities
        of life, fear of vengeful gods, of death, and punishment after death.
        Christianity was bound to have an offer to substitute for this; and Paul
        writes in Galatians 5:13: &quot;For it was on the presumption of freedom
        that you Galatians were called, brethren,&quot; and to this he adds,
        with silent reference to Epicurus: &quot;only not to the kind of freedom
        that means license to the flesh.&quot; The new freedom is emancipation
        from the bondage of sin.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        Faith, Hope, and Love</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The discovery of faith as a virtue was an incident in
        the life story of Epicurus. One of the thinkers who captured his
        interest in his student days was Pyrrho, the skeptic, who had resigned
        himself to belief in the impossibility of certainty in knowledge.
        Epicurus, however, was not the man to resign himself; he rebelled,
        discerning that uncertainty was incompatible with assured peace of mind.
        So he became a dogmatist, the first dogmatist among the Greek
        philosophers.</p>
        <p align="justify">He gave up controversy and began to write as one
        having authority. Among other writings, for example, he published his
        forty Authorized Doctrines, veritable Articles of Faith, which his
        disciples were to commit to memory. Thus faith made its first appearance
        as faith in doctrine. The solid core of truth in this teaching was too
        precious to be cast overboard by his successors. Among these was Paul,
        who discerned even a higher value in the new virtue and transformed its
        meaning to denote faith in the resurrected Christ, though in its more
        general aspect it became faith in God.</p>
        <p align="justify">The virtue of hope has a similar history. It was
        Epicurus who first assigned to it a specific role in a plan of life.
        Paul found for it a new role in the plan of salvation. Epicurus deemed
        it necessary in planning the mortal life to make a rational choice of
        attitudes; hope was the rational attitude to assume toward the future;
        the wise man should so order his life as to be justified in the hope of
        pleasures to come. This function of hope was recognized by Paul when he
        wrote, &quot;Love hopeth all things,&quot; but a new and specific
        meaning for the word was found in the hope of the resurrection.</p>
        <p align="justify">Love, like hope, had one aspect for Epicurus and two
        for Paul. To his followers Epicurus offered the lure of friendship and
        good companionship; in their own circles his disciples were known as
        &quot;Friends of Epicurus.&quot; Paul never employs the words friend or
        friendship; he brushes them aside and substitutes the larger concept of
        the love of God. His readers are urgently exhorted to love one another
        but this brotherly love becomes a particular aspect of the larger
        concept, the love of God. To love one another is to imitate God.</p>
        <p align="justify">The fact remains, nevertheless, that the philosophy
        of friendship flourished in advance of the religion of love and created
        a climate of feeling favorable to its reception.</p>
        <p align="justify">These three topics will be suitably amplified in the
        chapter on Faith, Hope, and Love.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        Suavity and Peace</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Of the three watchwords of the Epicureans cited by
        St. Augustine, pleasure, suavity, and peace, the first has been
        discussed above. Suavity and peace await brief mention.</p>
        <p align="justify">Suavity was defined by Cicero, not without having the
        Epicureans in mind, as &quot;an agreeableness of speech and
        manners.&quot; This virtue defined the proper attitude to assume toward
        all men and especially toward outsiders, just as Paul advises in
        Colossians 4:5-6, as the Revised Standard renders it: &quot;Conduct
        yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time. Let
        your speech always be gracious.&quot; Within the Epicurean circle this
        suavity or courtesy was to be joined with candor. Friends were to
        correct one another without animus and accept correction without
        resentment, just as Paul writes in Ephesians 4:15 under the formula,
        &quot;speaking the truth in love.&quot; This topic will be touched upon
        here and there in the chapters that follow.</p>
        <p align="justify">Just as Epicurus held out to mankind the pleasures of
        friendship and good companionship, seasoned with courtesy and candor, so
        he offered the enjoyment of peace. Peace presents two aspects. So far as
        it means peace of mind, it overlaps the concept of freedom, which among
        other things means freedom from fears. This has been dealt with already.</p>
        <p align="justify">So far as peace of mind means happy relationships in
        the family and community, this depends chiefly upon the virtue of
        considerateness, of which Epicurus made a specialty. While this virtue
        applies to all contacts of the individual with others, a single
        particular may be cited for illustration.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was the custom of the ancients to beat their
        slaves, often without mercy. That Epicurus was opposed to this corporal
        punishment we are informed by his biographer; and Paul, when listing the
        qualifications of a good bishop in First Timothy 3:3, warns specifically
        that he must not be &quot;given to blows but considerate,&quot;
        employing the Epicurean word for considerate, which nowhere occurs in
        the Gospels. In this passage no ancient reader would have failed to
        observe that the reference is to the treatment of slaves; even their
        feelings deserved consideration if family life was to be peaceful.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus the philosophy of peace was flourishing in
        advance of the religion of peace. What Paul did was to rehabilitate the
        whole concept of peace and assemble all aspects of it under a single
        phrase, &quot;the peace of God.&quot; It may be added that the phrases
        &quot;gospel of peace&quot; and &quot;God of peace&quot; are peculiar to
        his Epistles.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        Plausible Reasonings</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">In his Epistle to the Colossians, 2:4, Paul issues a
        warning against the &quot;enticing words&quot; or &quot;beguiling
        speech&quot; of the Epicurean competitors, whom he will never name.
        These translations are imprecise; the meaning is rather &quot;plausible
        reasonings,&quot; and we shall improve our understanding if we succeed
        in pinning the meaning down to specific references.</p>
        <p align="justify">What Paul fears is the attractiveness of the
        doctrines compiled by Epicurus in numerous textbooks. These doctrines
        were simply stated and in forms that were readily memorized. As a
        specimen we may choose the classification of the desires, which was
        widely known in antiquity: &quot;Of the desires some are natural and
        necessary; some are natural but not necessary; and others are neither
        natural nor necessary.&quot; This is Authorized Doctrine 29.</p>
        <p align="justify">The neatness of this classification was acknowledged
        even by Cicero. It is not only neat and easy to remember; it is also
        easy to expand. The natural and necessary desires are four: for food,
        drink, clothing, and housing. Jesus himself may have had this list in
        mind when, as recorded in Matthew 6:25, he said, &quot;what ye shall eat
        or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put
        on.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The point that is regularly urged by Epicurus is
        this, that it wounds our vanity &quot;but occasions no pain to the body
        if we lack the garment resplendent with purple and adorned with striking
        designs in thread of gold, providing only we have a plain cloak to fend
        off the cold.&quot; To covet costly raiment is to labor under a
        delusion, the false idea that it contributes to happiness.</p>
        <p align="justify">The second class of desires, those that are natural
        but not necessary, are sexual, as also those for luxurious viands and
        rare wines. No harm results if these are not gratified.</p>
        <p align="justify">The third class, the desires that are neither natural
        nor necessary, is curiously defined in an ancient commentary as
        referring to &quot;crowns and statues in public places.&quot; Greek
        statesmen were sometimes awarded circlets of gold as rewards for public
        service. The warning of Epicurus in this instance is against all highly
        competitive careers, which bring no real happiness. Paul too has
        warnings to issue against the competitive spirit; in Philippians 1:17 he
        even identifies men who, thinking to cause him affliction,
        &quot;proclaim the gospel of Christ out of a spirit of
        competition.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If now we make a last scrutiny of this
        classification, we should observe that its popularity made of the
        desires a foremost topic in the public mind. Epicurus, of course,
        recognized many desires as natural and only potentially injurious. This
        attitude was untenable for Paul. In his view of things, the very name of
        desire was in the same class as the word pleasure, both of them tainted
        with suspicion because of the association with the flesh. Thus the word
        pleasure is banned from his vocabulary and the word desire used
        regularly in an evil sense.</p>
        <p align="justify">This very cautiousness of Paul, however, reveals both
        his fears and his awareness of the Epicurean teaching. This awareness is
        revealed to us sometimes by a single word. For instance, in a certain
        saying Epicurus employs the phrase, &quot;injurious desires,&quot; which
        is found also in First Timothy 6:9, though even this adjective injurious
        occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. When Paul recognizes
        &quot;injurious desires,&quot; he tacitly recognizes desires that are
        not injurious, just as Epicurus taught.</p>
        <p align="justify">The evidence is not confined, however, to one word.
        Paul also employs a word that was probably coined by Epicurus, <i>kenodoxia</i><i>,
        </i>as in Philippians 2:3, where mistranslations are the rule. The
        reasoning behind this is simple; if we allow our desires to make our
        decisions for us, we become victims of a delusion or cherish an
        illusion. For example, we imagine that riches spell happiness.</p>
        <p align="justify">About the topic of wealth and poverty and &quot;the
        deceitfulness of riches&quot; Epicurus had much to say himself and
        regarded it as of such importance as to turn it over to his trusted
        colleague Metrodorus for amplification in a separate treatise. Opposed
        to the delusive vision of happiness that went with wealth was the
        genuine happiness that resulted from contentment with little, and much
        remains to be said about this in connection with Philippians 4:10-13 and
        First Timothy 6:6-10.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the meantime, we may quote four aphorisms of the
        sort that justify the popularity of Epicurean teachings in the times of
        the New Testament:</p>
        <p align="justify">Nothing is enough for a man for whom enough is too
        little.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of contentment with little the greatest fruit is
        freedom.</p>
        <p align="justify">To acquire great wealth and live a life of freedom is
        impossible.</p>
        <p align="justify">It were better for you to recline upon a cheap cot in
        peace of mind than to have a gilded bedstead and a luxurious table and a
        soul in turmoil.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        Theology</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The jaundiced tradition that denounces Epicurus as an
        atheist is sheer slander. In point of fact he regarded himself as a
        religious reformer, who was recalling mankind to a more pure and lofty
        conception of the divine being.</p>
        <p align="justify">He maintained the belief in the existence of gods to
        be innate in the mind of man and to exist there in advance of all
        religious experience. As evidence of this he cited the universal
        response of mankind to the belief in the existence of gods.</p>
        <p align="justify">He conceived of the divine nature as &quot;blessed
        and incorruptible.&quot; Upon his disciples he urged the necessity of
        associating no idea with the divine nature that was inconsistent with
        this perfection of happiness and incorruptibility. The supreme duty of
        man was reverence; the very names of the gods should be sacred. No task
        was to be ascribed to them that was by its nature onerous, such as
        superintending the operations of the universe, which was to be thought
        self-operating under natural laws.</p>
        <p align="justify">The very first of his Authorized Doctrines declared
        the gods to be incapable of anger. Anger was a disturbing emotion and a
        symptom of weakness; to ascribe such an emotion to the gods was to
        detract from their sanctity and to diminish their claim to the worship
        of mankind. Upon this worship as embodied in the public festivals,
        especially the music, he placed supreme importance and among his sayings
        is one to the effect that &quot;the wise man will derive more enjoyment
        than other men from the state festivals.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If this elimination of anger from celestial minds was
        offensive to orthodox pagan Greeks, it was still more so when it became
        known to orthodox Jews, whose Jehovah bore a unique reputation as a God
        of wrath. Equally offensive was the removal of the gods from all
        participation in human affairs, which involved the rejection of belief
        in divine prophecy, in miracles, and divine providence.</p>
        <p align="justify">These teachings were judged to cancel all the merit
        that resided in the demand of Epicurus for more reverence for godhead;
        they relegated him to the evil eminence of being the archenemy of
        religion and a sort of Antichrist.</p>
        <p align="justify">We should recall, however, the words of Paul in
        Second Thessalonians 2:3: &quot;for that day will not come, unless the
        rebellion comes first.&quot; In the procession of time the rebellion of
        Epicurus did come first and as a consequence the God of wrath of the Old
        Testament was transformed into the God of love of the New Testament.

        </font></b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4">T</font><font size="2">HE </font>Epistle to the Philippians
        happens to be suitable for beginning a study of Epicureanism in the
        writings of Paul. The two parties in each community from which the chief
        opposition arose to the invading Christianity are here typically but
        briefly presented. The first was the fundamentalist party among the
        Jews, which is unmistakably identified even for the modern reader by the
        word <i>circumcision.</i> The second party consisted of the ubiquitous
        and numerous disciples of Epicurus of which the identity was as plainly
        manifest to the ancient reader as was that of the Jewish
        fundamentalists, though to the modern reader the symbols of
        identification have long since become meaningless.</p>
        <p align="justify">In order to restore meaning to these symbols the
        reader must learn first where to expect them and in order to know where
        to expect them he must know how Paul's letters are put together. They
        are composed according to a good Greek formula, which was recognized and
        recommended by Artistotle. If from each Epistle the salutation and
        concluding messages be lopped off, the body of the letter will be seen
        to consist of three parts, a beginning, middle, and end.</p>
        <p align="justify">The beginning conciliatory: Paul compliments the
        community for its faith or for its kindness to him in the past. This is
        the bid for good will and a sympathetic hearing, well known to
        rhetoricians as the <i>captatio benevolentiae</i>. The middle part
        contains warnings, expositions of doctrine, and scoldings, if any, which
        might' possibly try the good will and patience of readers. The
        concluding passage is reserved for friendly admonition and exhortation.</p>
        <p align="justify">This happens to be a good Epicurean pattern. The same
        formula is employed by the Epicurean poet Lucretius. He begins each book
        with a flourish of enthusiasm, packs all the prosaic material in the
        middle, and takes care to conclude, as if leaving the lectern and
        mounting the pulpit, with a lofty discourse upon ethics. Even the three
        extant letters of Epicurus conclude with brief moral exhortation.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is in the middle part of the Epistles of Paul that
        offensive doctrines of the Epicureans are to be expected; it is in the
        last section of each Epistle that adoptable features of the friendly
        Epicurean ethics are to be expected. Of the two kinds of doctrine, the
        offensive and the adoptable, the former are the easier to identify. For
        example, in the Epistle to the Philippians we should have but little
        trouble in learning to identify the Epicureans either by the words
        &quot;their god is the belly&quot; or &quot;they glory in their
        shame.&quot; On the other hand, a keener discernment must be acquired to
        recognize Epicurean teaching toward the end in 4:11: &quot;for I have
        learned in whatever state I am, therewith to be content.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">When once we have become thoroughly alerted to the
        implications of Paul's words and phrases the references to the
        Epicureans will prove to be numerous. For example, when he speaks in
        3:18 of &quot;the enemies of the cross of Christ,&quot; this denotation
        of the rival sect will be found elaborated in First Corinthians, where
        the logic of the Epicureans is opposed to &quot;the word of the
        cross,&quot; that is, spirituality. Again, when he writes in 3:19,
        &quot;Their end is destruction,&quot; this doom is specifically
        predicted for the Epicureans in First Thessalonians 5:3, where they are
        identified by their catchwords Peace and Safety. Again, when in 3:19 he
        writes, &quot;with minds set on earthly things,&quot; the antithesis
        between &quot;things that are on earth&quot; and &quot;things that are
        above,&quot; with demonstrable reference to Epicureanism, may be found
        elaborated in Colossians 3.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><br>
        Their God Is the Belly</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">All of these allusions are damning enough but the
        more serious are two (3:19): &quot;their god is the belly&quot; and
        &quot;they glory in their shame.&quot; Both reproaches are as old as
        Epicureanism itself. The former has been the longer lived; it may be
        found in any English dictionary today by looking up the word epicure,
        which will be found to denote a sensualist and especially one who is
        given over to the pleasures of the stomach. In the Middle Ages the idea
        was expressed in pictures. In one of these Epicurus is represented in
        company with Sardanapalus, an infamous oriental voluptuary.</p>
        <p align="justify">It mattered little that this charge was false. It has
        been rightly said that Epicurus is the most calumniated of all
        philosophers. His offense, in the eyes of his enemies, was to have
        reached the conclusion that pleasure was the chief good in life or, to
        be more precise, the chief end of man as demonstrated by the teaching of
        Nature herself. Even the newly born, Epicurus pointed out, whether brute
        or human, reaches out for pleasure as the greatest good and shrinks from
        pain as the greatest evil.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the judgment of his enemies, it was not to be
        chalked up to his credit that by the teaching of the very same Nature
        who identified pleasure as the greatest good the definition of true
        pleasure was so narrowed as to demand of her devotees a strictness of
        life that was almost ascetic. The pleasure of drinking, for example, was
        to be limited by the quenching of thirst; the pleasure of eating was to
        be limited by the satisfaction of hunger.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of these principles Paul was fully aware, as he was
        of the whole doctrine of Epicurus, and in Colossians 2:23, he even shows
        himself compelled to concede some merit in them, although to ascertain
        his exact attitude the translation will require correction. This will be
        one of the many passages where the knowledge of Epicurean doctrine will
        help us to discover what Paul was intending to say.</p>
        <p align="justify">In addition to the general sponsorship of pleasure
        there were specific teachings that lent plausibility to the charge that
        &quot;their god is the belly.&quot; One of these stems from Metrodorus,
        able lieutenant of Epicurus: &quot;The pleasure of the stomach is the
        beginning and the root of all good, and in this the things of wisdom and
        the refinements of life have their standard of reference.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Quoted out of context this judgment exhibits a
        shocking rawness. It must be appraised, however, as part of a genetic
        approach to the study of ethics. It presumes that human life develops by
        stages: infancy, childhood, adolescence, and maturity. The pleasure of
        the stomach is the first one known in infancy; other organs with their
        respective pleasures come to activity one by one. The mind matures last
        of all and must be regarded as an organ of the physical being no less
        than the stomach. The poet Lucretius, for example, chooses to insist
        upon the point that the mind is an organ of the body no less than the
        ear.</p>
        <p align="justify">This adds up to the conclusion that pleasure is a
        common denominator of all bodily activity, mental activity not excluded,
        and justifies the declaration quoted above that &quot;in this . . . the
        refinements of life have their standard of reference.&quot; The timorous
        thinker would rather embrace unreason than be escorted by reason to such
        a verdict.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus, however, was quite immune to the timidity
        of the conventional moralist with regard to pleasure. He maintained that
        pleasure and health go together just as pain and disease; nor was it any
        more possible to dissociate pleasure from the healthy life than it was
        possible to dissociate heat from fire. Pleasure, he taught, is the
        ruling motive from the cradle to the grave. Even virtue is practiced for
        the sake of pleasure; the good life and the happy life go together just
        like sweetness and honey. He flouted the idea of Plato that the value of
        a virtue is diminished if accompanied by pleasure. &quot;I spit upon the
        beautiful,&quot; he wrote, &quot;if it fails to give pleasure.&quot;</p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        They Glory in Their Shame</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">It was the sponsorship of pleasure that from the
        first drew upon Epicurus the imputation of shamelessness. The very name
        of pleasure can be frightening to conventional morality and pious
        respectability. Aristotle ventured the judgment that even people who
        believed that pleasure had the sanction of Nature as the chief end of
        man would hesitate to sponsor the doctrine. Cicero, speaking for the man
        in public life, observed the impossibility of sponsoring pleasure
        &quot;in the forum, in the senate, or in the camp.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus was denounced by Timon, a vulgar satirist,
        as &quot;the lowest dog among the physicists,&quot; the dog being to the
        Greeks the symbol of shamelessness because it does in public what human
        beings veil with privacy. It is this satirical jab of the Greek Timon
        that enables us to interpret with unassailable certainty the reference
        to Epicureans in 3: 2: &quot;Beware of the dogs.&quot; It is this idea
        that Paul with his customary tenacity of topic is elaborating in 3:19:
        &quot;they glory in their shame.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">A variant of this general outcry was authored by the
        Platonists, who declared that to sponsor pleasure as the end of living
        as to bring life down to the level of the beasts. A censorious Stoic
        named Hierocles capped this chorus of denunciations by the acrid
        epigram: &quot;To believe that pleasure is the end is the creed of a
        prostitute; to deny providence is beneath even a prostitute.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Incidentally, the popular opinion that the Stoics
        were the outspoken and courageous sect is questionable. Their
        outspokenness was rather an affectation and their real intention was to
        astonish rather than to defy. Essentially they were reactionaries,
        fundamentalists in revolt against Epicurean hedonism. They made a great
        show of sponsoring the words and concepts that salve the consciences and
        flatter the vanity of mankind: virtue, duty, divine providence, reason.
        The hypocrites rallied to their side. Meanwhile, it was around Epicurus
        and the memory of him that &quot;all the dogs of philosophy were
        barking&quot; <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        <p align="justify">It required no courage to preach that virtue is the
        chief good. It did require courage to declare that the practice of
        virtue cannot be separated from pleasure, that the gods were not
        superintending engineers of a complicated universe, and that the divine
        being was incapable of anger.</p>
        <p align="justify">Even the Authorized Doctrines of Epicurus would have
        afforded ground for the accusation that &quot;they gloried in their
        shame.&quot; In certain of these Doctrines the founder had stated his
        teachings on the subject of pleasure with a directness that seemed like
        shameless defiance of orthodox morality. One of them reads: &quot;No
        pleasure is evil in itself but the practices productive of certain
        pleasures may result in distresses outweighing by many times the
        pleasures themselves.&quot; This means that all pleasures are good; the
        evil lies solely in their consequences.</p>
        <p align="justify">In another of these doctrines he went so far as to
        assert that if the pleasures of profligates dispelled the fears of the
        mind and similar disturbing emotions, &quot;we would never have cause to
        blame them, glutting themselves with pleasures from every side and
        experiencing no pain of body or distress of mind from any quarter, in
        which the evil lies.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This statement alone, originally published in the
        heat of controversy, even if no other evidence were citable, would
        justify the censure, &quot;they glory in their shame.&quot;</p>

        Minds Set on Earthly Things</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The mention of &quot;minds set on earthly
        things&quot; is a further identification of Epicureans. This refers to
        the fact that Epicurus based his whole system of ethics, including a
        very definite design for living, upon his Physics, of which the basic
        doctrine declared: &quot;The universe consists of atoms and void,&quot;
        implying definitely that nothing else really existed.</p>
        <p align="justify">A more suitable place for amplifying this topic will
        be presented by the Epistle to the Galatians. Here it may be profitable,
        however, to prepare the way by an advance notice to the effect that this
        materialism, based upon the atomic hypothesis, accounts in large part
        for a characteristic dualism in Paul's thought. The atoms stand for
        &quot;earthly things,&quot; that is, &quot;things that are on
        earth&quot; as opposed to &quot;things that are above,&quot; well known
        from Colossians 3: 2. Another guise of the same dualism is discerned in
        the opposition between the flesh and the Spirit and in &quot;the desires
        of the flesh&quot; and &quot;the desires of the Spirit,&quot; as also in
        &quot;the works of the flesh&quot; and &quot;the works of the
        Spirit,&quot; long stamped on Christian minds by Galatians 5:16-25.</p>
        <p align="justify">This dualism, a fruitful and fascinating feature of
        Pauline thought, was inherent in the philosophy of Epicurus, who thought
        of this earth we inhabit as a place &quot;where the forces of
        destruction always prevail in the end over the forces of creation,&quot;
        and set in opposition to it the heavenly regions, &quot;where the forces
        of preservation always prevail over the forces of destruction.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">We shall find this distinction making its
        reappearance in our study of the illustrious fifteenth chapter of First
        Corinthians. It will be seen to be there typified by the Pauline
        expository invention of &quot;the first Adam&quot; and &quot;the last
        Adam,&quot; the former the recipient at God's hand of mortal life --
        that is, corruption -- the second, Jesus Christ, endowed by God with the
        power to bestow immortal spiritual life -- that is, incorruption. This
        will be one of the many items of interpretation that serve to uncover
        for us the background of Paul's thought, just as a later painting is
        sometimes peeled off the wall of an ancient church to reveal a fresco of
        earlier Christianity.</p>
        <p align="justify">Such discoveries may have for their reward an
        improved understanding and more precise translations.</p>

        Rejoice in the Lord Always</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">In the last chapter of Philippians Paul turns to
        friendly admonitions, of which the firm but genial Epicurus had made a
        specialty long before him. It is in concluding sections of each letter
        that these adoptable teachings of the friendly pagan sect may most often
        be detected. A specimen may sometimes be identified in the simplest and
        most innocent admonition.</p>
        <p align="justify">Take, for example, 3:1, &quot;rejoice in the
        Lord,&quot; and 4:4. &quot;Rejoice in the Lord always.&quot; Why should
        Paul say &quot;always&quot; and why should he seek emphasis by
        repetition, &quot;Again I will say, Rejoice&quot;? Behind this lies a
        chapter of discussion in the history of philosophy. Plato, became rather
        notorious after his death for having put himself in a position to deny
        that a man could be happy all the time. He had associated pleasure with
        the various organs of the body. These, of course, cannot be in a state
        of excitement all the time. Consequently there must be peaks of pleasure
        separated by intervals devoid of pleasure or by &quot;mixed
        states,&quot; in which pain and pleasure are simultaneously present.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus, who followed closely upon Plato in point of
        time, vigorously rejected the assumption that continuous happiness was
        impossible. &quot;If your analysis of pleasure leads to this
        conclusion,&quot; he said in effect, &quot;then your analysis of
        pleasure is wrong.&quot; His solution was to associate pleasure with
        health just as pain is associated with disease. It follows that if a man
        can be healthy all the time, he can also be happy all the time.</p>
        <p align="justify">Moreover, he denied that pleasure and pain could be
        mixed, as Plato claimed. He maintained instead that pain could be
        subtracted from pleasure, leaving a balance of pleasure, and that this
        was true in all but the most acute illnesses. Hence Epicurus is on
        record as writing to a youthful correspondent: &quot;As for myself, it
        is to continuous pleasures that I invite you.&quot; His aim is to
        immunize the minds of his disciples against Platonic teachings without
        naming the adversary, an example that Paul copied in his treatment of
        Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">If we now bear in mind, as we ought, that Paul is
        addressing himself to communities in which Epicureans are numerous and
        that he is willing to become &quot;as a Greek to the Greeks&quot; in
        order to bring some of them over to his creed, could he afford to offer
        them less happiness than Epicurus had offered? Hardly. Therefore, his
        &quot;Rejoice in the Lord always&quot; may be taken as a substitute for
        the words of his competitor, &quot;It is to continuous pleasures that I
        invite you.&quot; Yet how completely the motivation has changed! In the
        logic of Epicurus pleasure is continuous because it can no more be
        separated from living than sweetness from honey; even the invalid can
        subtract the pain from the pleasure, leaving a balance of pleasure. The
        reason for the Christian's rejoicing, on the contrary, is the imminence
        of the second coming: &quot;The Lord is at hand.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Incidentally, the recognition of this fact reveals an
        error of translation in the Revised Standard, which reads in 4:5:
        &quot;Let all men know your forbearance.&quot; It is not forbearance
        that this happy expectation demands but consistency; unless they rejoice
        their conduct will not be in keeping with their belief. Consequently,
        for the sake of precision we should read: &quot;Let your consistency be
        known to all men.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It may be interjected, by the way, that the Greek
        word here rendered &quot;consistency&quot; occurs only in the Epistles
        and is a favorite of the Epicureans. It denotes propriety in matters of
        conduct, that is, what befits or becomes a person in a particular case.</p>

        Whatsoever Things Are True</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Paul's reluctant partiality for the vocabulary of
        Epicurus often supplies the clue that leads to precision of
        interpretation, and, as already mentioned, this is especially true of
        the concluding sections of the Epistles, where adoptable items of the
        friendly creed most often present themselves. Take for an example the
        familiar verse 4:8, which begins, &quot;Finally, brethren, whatsoever
        things are true, whatsoever things are honest.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">As a devotional reading this ephonious passage has
        been casting its spell over innumerable congregations for the space of
        centuries, but how many of the worshipers who have experienced comfort
        and uplift from the sound of it could explain exactly what is meant by
        &quot;whatsoever things are lovely&quot;? Would the translators
        themselves be capable of explaining? To press this question might prove
        to be embarrassing.</p>
        <p align="justify">In advance of the experiment of trying to discover
        what this verse would have signified to an Epicurean a word of caution
        is in order. It is not being denied that Paul was capable of using his
        language artfully, but it will be emphatically denied that he was ever
        willing to sacrifice meaning for the sake of euphony. It will be
        consistently assumed instead that his ideas are clean-cut and his
        references definite at all times. The problem will be to pinpoint the
        reference and to bring the meaning into focus.</p>
        <p align="justify">In seeking help from Epicurus to explain Paul it
        deserves also to be brought to knowledge that this procedure involves a
        shocking rivalry of loyalties. In the Greek language the name <i>Epicurus</i>
        signifies &quot;helper&quot; or &quot;succorer&quot; and this may
        account in part for Paul's detestation of it and unwillingness to
        mention it. To concede to the adversary the title of helper, which by
        implication belonged to Jesus, was only one degree less repellent than
        to know that his disciples knew him as a savior, which they did.
        Epicurus became virtually a sort of Antichrist.</p>
        <p align="justify">This understandable aversion is nevertheless not
        unmixed with reluctant admiration, which is also understandable, because
        Epicurus and his disciples had surpassed all others in their shrewd
        studies of human behavior. Paul's admiration is revealed in the words he
        employs.</p>
        <p align="justify">It will be best for us to begin with &quot;whatsoever
        things are lovely,&quot; because the word lovely is so very vague. There
        is no vagueness in its Greek counterpart, <i>prosphiles,</i> which
        applies to a person's demeanor and signifies &quot;friendly&quot; or
        &quot;disposed to make friends.&quot; It is citable in Epicurean
        writings and in the New Testament only in this verse. The disciples of
        Epicurus were urged &quot;all at the same time to wear a smile and
        practice their philosophy.&quot; They were a cheerful and ingratiating
        breed of men, aiming &quot;to make friends with as many people as
        possible.&quot; They made a cult of friendliness.</p>
        <p align="justify">It becomes manifest, therefore, that what Paul is
        urging upon the Philippians is to let their thoughts dwell upon
        &quot;whatever makes for friendliness.&quot; The meaning is clean-cut.</p>
        <p align="justify">Now that we have discovered Paul to be speaking of
        the proper demeanor for Christians we are in a better position to make a
        try for the meaning of &quot;whatsoever things are agood report&quot; or
        &quot;whatever is gracious,&quot; as the Revised Standard has it. Both
        of these are needlessly vague. The Greek word here employed is the
        opposite of &quot;blasphemous,&quot; which originally meant
        &quot;slanderous.&quot; So Paul's meaning becomes clear; he is urging
        the Philippians to let their thoughts dwell upon &quot;whatever makes
        for charity in speaking of others.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Next let attention be turned to &quot;whatsoever
        things are honest&quot; or, as in the Revised Standard, &quot;whatever
        is honorable.&quot; The Greek word is <i>semnos</i> and means neither
        &quot;honest&quot; nor &quot;honorable&quot; but &quot;worthy of
        reverence.&quot; It is used in the New Testament only by Paul and was a
        favorite of Epicurus. The latter demanded reverence for himself as the
        discoverer of truth and declared the principle: &quot;Reverence for the
        wise man is a great blessing for him who feels the reverence.&quot;
        Moreover, he required of each disciple to show reverence for all who
        were farther advanced than himself on the way to wisdom.</p>
        <p align="justify">Let us next scrutinize Paul's own use of this
        Epicurean word. In First Timothy 3:8 and 11 and Titus 2:2 he requires
        that deacons, elders and women should so deport themselves &quot;as to
        be worth of reverence.&quot; Conversely, he is urging the Philippians
        always to display reverence toward those who had been appointed to
        positions of superiority over them, precisely as Epicurus had demanded
        reverence for those who were farther advanced in wisdom.</p>
        <p align="justify">In other words, Paul is making the Christian pattern
        of behavior. acceptable to Epicurean converts by adapting to the needs
        of the new community the very pattern of behavior to which they were
        already habituated. In his own words, he was making himself&nbsp;
        &quot;as a Greek to the Greeks,&quot; which means &quot;as an Epicurean
        to the Epicureans.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The requirements of precision will be served if we
        translate this as &quot;whatever makes for reverence.&quot; The same
        exhortation expressed in other words may be found as a parting
        admonition in First Thessalonians 5:12 and Hebrews 13:7 and 17.</p>
        <p align="justify">In dealing with the remaining items of Paul's list of
        injunctions the principle should still apply, that his reference is
        invariably precise. For example, in the case of &quot;whatever is
        pure,&quot; the reference is to fornication and homosexual practices. It
        is a fact no less deplorable than well authenticated that these vices
        were often condoned by Greek philosophers. even by Plato, as Cicero
        conceded. It is not true, however, as sometimes asserted, that the
        Christians were the first to set their faces against such inchastities.
        Epicurus had taken the same stand three centuries before.</p>
        <p align="justify">Plato had even dreamed that the passion of the flesh
        could be sublimated into a passion for knowledge and it was in reply to
        this astonishing teaching that Epicurus retorted crisply: &quot;Sexual
        intercourse never did anyone any good and it is fortunate if it does no
        harm.&quot; He was unable to call it an offense against the gods,
        because he declared them indifferent to human wickedness, but he did
        denounce it for its ugly fruits, which he took pains to enumerate.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this instance we may recognize yet another segment
        of the common ground of doctrine between Epicureanism and Christianity
        which eased the transition from the age of philosophy to that of
        religion. The truth of this statement is not canceled by the fact that
        the sponsorship of pleasure by Epicurus was sometimes made an excuse for
        loose living. Even Paul's doctrine of election by God for salvation was
        seized upon by some as a license to sin; if a man had been elected for
        salvation, it was argued, laxity of conduct could not alter the fact.</p>
        <p align="justify">The usual precision of reference is to be demanded
        for the next item of Paul's six injunctions, &quot;whatsoever things are
        just.&quot; To assume that the reference is to righteousness is not
        specific enough. In the everyday ethic of Epicurus the meaning of
        justice was obedience to the law of the land. In one context we find him
        writing: &quot;Let us do everything honorably according to the
        laws.&quot; In Romans 13:1 Paul writes: &quot;Let every person be
        subject governing authorities.&quot; Epicurus writes: &quot;The laws are
        enacted far the of the wise, not that they may do wrong, but to prevent
        them from suffering wrong.&quot; Paul writes in Romans 13:3: &quot;For
        rulers are not a deterrent to good behavior but to bad.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">These quotations demonstrate plainly that the
        attitude of Paul toward the civil authorities is practically identical
        with that of Epicurus, but, as usual, the motivation is different. In
        this chapter of Romans Paul takes the position that &quot;the powers
        that be are ordained of God&quot; and that &quot;love is the fulfilling
        of the law.&quot; In the last analysis, according to him, the Christian
        obeys the law &quot;because love worketh no ill to his neighbor.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Neither was the motivation of Epicurus coldly
        utilitarian. His biographer speaks of his patriotic attitude toward his
        country as &quot;beyond words to describe.&quot; If in his candor he
        often mentioned the motive of expediency, we must also remember that the
        most honorable action may also be profitable.</p>
        <p align="justify">In respect of this question of obedience to the law
        the procedure of Paul himself deserves to be scanned. In spite of the
        fact that in First Thessalonians 5: 3 he poured contempt upon the
        catchwords of Peace and Safety, he was by no means blind to the wisdom
        of the Epicurean practice. For himself he did not pursue safety; at
        times it was his deliberate choice not to seek protection for himself as
        a Roman citizen: he submitted to scourging under Roman law just as he
        had submitted to flogging under Jewish law. For the members of his
        churches, on the contrary, he coveted the blessings of peace and safety.
        He encouraged for them no cult of martyrdom any more than Epicurus
        encouraged it for his followers. It was after his time, though
        immediately afterward, that the leaders of Christianity began to find
        reason for the defiance of Roman law.</p>
        <p align="justify">Only one of Paul's six injunctions now awaits
        explanation: &quot;whatsoever things are true.&quot; This, like the
        others, may be redeemed from its present vagueness by recourse to the
        precepts of Epicurus. He required of his disciples total truthfulness in
        personal relations. This virtue was to be seasoned with courtesy, not
        peppered with censure, as with the Stoics. Expressed in Latin, where it
        is well authenticated, the ideal was <i>comitas</i> with <i>severitas,</i>
        a kindly courtesy joined with unflinching veracity. It was for this
        combination of traits that Atticus, the Epicurean friend of Cicero, was
        praised; his biographer writes of him that &quot;it was hard to decide
        whether his friends feared or loved him more.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Commendable as this union of courtesy with veracity
        may seem to be, it still falls short of describing the whole meaning of
        truthfulness according to Epicurus. Veracity must be demanded as well as
        practiced. Of the Epicurean Atticus it is recorded: &quot;He would
        neither be guilty of telling a lie nor of submitting to listen to
        one.&quot; Is it then likely that Paul was demanding less when he wrote
        in Colossians 3:9: &quot;Do not lie to one another,&quot; and in
        Galatians 6:1: &quot;Brethren, if a man is overtaken in some misdoing,
        you who are spiritual should set him right in a spirit of
        gentleness&quot;?</p>
        <p align="justify">It is hard to escape the conclusion that all three
        aspects of truthfulness are in the mind of Paul: to speak the truth, to
        demand that others speak the truth, and to correct the friend without
        condemning him.</p>
        <p align="justify">Incidentally, the words <i>gentle</i> and <i>gentleness</i>
        seem to have been overworked in our translations of the New Testament.
        They are not specific enough. For instance, in the sentence above it
        would be more precise to read &quot;a spirit of considerateness.&quot;
        The Epicurean combination of truthfulness with a considerate courtesy
        undoubtedly attracted Paul. In Ephesians 4: 15 he calls it
        &quot;speaking the truth in love.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If now we pause and survey these findings and set
        them in order, it will appear that the rhythm of this sententious verse,
        as we have come to know it in the King James Version, has been
        sacrificed, but by way of compensation the true significance of each
        item has been fixed with precision and the reference of all to the
        appropriate area of conduct has been defined. The residue may be worded
        as follows in plain prose: &quot;Finally, brethren, everything that
        promotes truthfulness, everything that promotes reverence, everything
        that promotes respect for law, everything that promotes chastity,
        everything that promotes friendliness, everything that promotes charity
        in speech, whatever virtue there be, whatever be worthy of praise, think
        on these things.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Think on These Things</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Out of our prosaic version submitted above it has
        been thought worth while to reserve for closer scrutiny the final
        injunction of Paul, &quot;think on these things.&quot; In these innocent
        words we shall find something more than meets the eye. To this formula
        of writing the reading public of the time had long been habituated by
        the textbooks of Epicurus. For example, he concludes the hortatory
        letter to the lad Menoeceus with the advice, &quot;Meditate upon these
        things.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">A rewarding clue may be found in the verb employed by
        Paul. It is more colorful than think. It has been taken over from the
        domain of arithmetic and means &quot;to do figuring&quot; or, we may
        say, &quot;to calculate,&quot; because the ancients used pebbles in
        counting. The word calculus means &quot;pebble&quot; in Latin.</p>
        <p align="justify">This verb signifying &quot;to calculate&quot; is
        often used by Paul; it does not occur in the Gospels but is a favorite
        of Epicurus. For instance, he recommends to the lad Menoeceus the
        practice of &quot;sober calculation, which searches out the reasons for
        deciding to do or not to do any particular thing.&quot; In another
        context he puts the same advice in a different shape, saying in effect:
        &quot;What will be the result for me if I choose to do this and what
        will be the result if I choose not to do it?&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">To illustrate by an imaginary example: &quot;This
        sumptuous meal will make me ill but my stomach hankers for it. Will the
        pleasure be worth the pain?&quot; Modern critics have disdainfully
        dubbed this &quot;the calculus of pleasure&quot; but more precisely it
        may be called &quot;the calculus of advantage.&quot; In this same letter
        to Menoeceus Epicurus writes: &quot;The proper procedure in all actions
        is to scan the advantages and the disadvantages and weigh them against
        each other.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This calculus of advantage under the name of
        expediency is in bad odor today and has been seized upon to justify the
        denunciation of Epicurus as an &quot;egoistic hedonist,&quot; actuated
        solely by self-interest. This charge, however, will not bear a moment's
        scrutiny. Epicurus came very close to enunciating the Golden Rule and
        declares in one of his best-known Authorized Doctrines that a man cannot
        live pleasurably unless honorably, that is, in accordance with the
        unwritten laws that govern the conduct of a gentleman. In another saying
        he warns a young man who was prone to sexual indulgence against
        &quot;causing distress to a neighbor&quot; and in this context he was
        expressly stating the principle of expediency.</p>
        <p align="justify">This topic was a familiar ingredient of public
        knowledge in Paul's time and he reveals ample awareness of it, employing
        the same terminology as Epicurus. He is also at one with Epicurus in
        understanding expediency as the good of one's neighbor. For instance, he
        writes in First Corinthians 10:23-24: &quot;All things are permissible
        for me but all things are not expedient; all things are permissible for
        me but not all things are edifying. Let no man seek his own good but the
        good of the other man.&quot; Both he and Epicurus conceive of advantage
        or expediency as being a reciprocal thing, the parties to the action
        being mutually benefited.</p>
        <p align="justify">It will consequently be justifiable, when Paul writes
        &quot;think on these things,&quot; to infer that his meaning is definite
        and specific, that he is encouraging his readers to make a practice of
        striking a balance between the advantages, for example, of speaking
        charitably of others and the disadvantages of speaking maliciously, or
        between the advantages of showing one's self friendly and the
        disadvantages of discourtesy and surliness.</p>
        <p align="justify">We should next observe that this technique of
        meditation, measuring the gains of virtue against the costs of vice,
        conduces to peace of mind in the individual and peace in the community.
        This boon of peace in both its aspects was a chief objective of Epicurus
        no less than of Paul; but Paul cannot afford to appear to be in debt to
        philosophy, much less to Epicurus. He consequently ignores his
        predecessor even while building upon the foundation he had laid and
        concludes with the words, &quot;and the God of peace will be with
        you.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The philosophy of peace is in process of being
        replaced by the religion of peace.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        In Whatsoever State I Am</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">There is a definite irony in the fact that Paul
        should have hurled at the Epicureans the taunt of making a god of the
        belly and then wind up his letter with the topic of self-control in
        matters of eating, revealing that his teaching is up to a certain point
        identical with that of Epicurus. The words in which he sums up his
        doctrine, &quot;in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content,&quot;
        hold equally valid as summing up the creed of his competitor.</p>
        <p align="justify">The King James Version, however, was &quot;appointed
        to be read in churches&quot; and the instructions of the translators
        were to produce a book of devotion, in which they succeeded
        magnificently. For this use their version is irreplaceable but for the
        purpose of study a more precise rendering is needed. To attain this end
        it becomes consequently necessary to sacrifice the euphony for the sake
        of the precision which was previously sacrificed for the sake of the
        euphony.</p>
        <p align="justify">The topic of self-control in eating and drinking was
        a hackneyed one and the key word in the discussions was <i>autarkes, </i>here
        translated as &quot;content,&quot; though &quot;self-sufficient&quot;
        would be more exact. It is used by many philosophers, Epicurus not
        excepted, but in the New Testament only by Paul. A quick glance at the
        history of the idea will be in order. To Diogenes the Cynic
        self-sufficiency signified independence of all the amenities of life,
        including food, clothing, and shelter, and he chose to sleep in an
        overturned wine cask, as if in a kennel. Against this beastliness the
        gentlemanly Epicurus rebelled with vigor and he defined the word anew to
        mean independence of all changes of fortune, such as from riches to
        poverty or freedom to slavery, along with the compulsions and privations
        that attend them.</p>
        <p align="justify">Even in a brief statement of his teaching may be
        discerned the repudiation of Diogenes: &quot;And self-sufficiency we
        believe to be a great good, not that we may live on little under all
        circumstances, but that we may be content with little when we do not
        have much.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">With this judgment Paul was in total accord. He saw
        no intrinsic merit in stinting one's self systematically nor any demerit
        in eating heartily when plenty was available. The merit consisted in
        being prepared to adapt one's self to circumstances. Neither did this
        readiness to adapt one's self, either in his case or in that of
        Epicurus, mean resigning one's self. In either event, plenty or want,
        the man was equally master of himself, always under self-control. Paul
        knows the regular Greek term for self-control, and uses it once,
        Galatians 5: 2 3; it denotes a &quot;fruit of the Spirit.&quot; It is
        not found in the Gospels.</p>
        <p align="justify">The question of riches and contentment is briefly
        discussed by Paul in First Timothy 6:6-10, where a knowledge of
        Epicureanism will clarify the meaning and improve the translation, which
        in the Revised Standard is somewhat obscure and ambiguous, as in verse
        6: &quot;There is great gain in godliness with contentment.&quot; Paul
        is not intending us to believe that contentment results in a &quot;gain
        in godliness.&quot; The clue to the meaning is to be found in a famous
        saying of Epicurus, excerpted from a letter to a patron who was
        financing the studies of a lad Pythocles: &quot;If you wish to make
        Pythocles really rich, do not add to the money, but subtract from his
        desires.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This is a paradox and we must concentrate sharply to
        grasp it. Another saying of Epicurus will help: &quot;Nothing is enough
        for a man for whom enough is too little.&quot; In other words, the
        adequacy of income varies with the desires; as the desires diminish the
        income may be said to increase.</p>
        <p align="justify">We must now concentrate again to read this meaning
        into Paul's words. He first speaks of evil men who &quot;think godliness
        a means of increasing their income.&quot; To this he retorts:
        &quot;Godliness joined with self-sufficiency means an amazing increase
        of income.&quot; Instead of &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; translators
        have accustomed us to read &quot;contentment&quot; and to this there is
        no objection as long as we understand it to mean &quot;contentment with
        little,&quot; concerning which Cicero informs us that &quot;no one had
        more to say than Epicurus.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This is one of several instances where a passage much
        preferred as a devotional reading is Epicurean in both subject and
        sentiment. The Greek term for &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; or
        &quot;contentment with little&quot; occurs only here in the New
        Testament.</p>
        <p align="justify">With all these facts kept well in mind and the
        willingness to sacrifice the euphonious liberties of the King James
        Version for the sake of precision, verses 11-12 may be rendered as
        follows: &quot;Not that I speak of not having enough, for I have learned
        to content myself with the conditions in which I find myself; I know how
        to humble myself and I know how to restrain myself when there is more
        than enough; under any and all conditions I understand how to eat my
        fill and how to endure hunger, and likewise how to act when there is
        more than enough and how to content myself when there is less than
        enough.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Beyond this point Paul is no longer in accord with
        Epicurus and, as usual, the necessity of their parting can be traced to
        the motivation. Epicurus was perpetuating the time-honored assumption of
        the rational Greeks that virtue is knowledge, though he invokes his own
        version of this principle, that is, the calculus of advantage. He
        carefully lists the advantages that accrue to the side of moderation and
        these may be quoted in summary: &quot;It is conducive to health; it
        enables the individual to face unflinchingly the vicissitudes of life;
        it disposes men to exercise better judgment when rich foods become
        available after intervals of scarcity; lastly, it renders men dauntless
        in the face of Fortune.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In this seemingly unimpeachable pronouncement the
        lurking fallacy in Paul's judgment is the assumption that right reason
        is a guarantee of right action. What the system lacks is the dynamic
        element, some power to ensure that the individual will possess the
        resolution to do what reason has judged to be advantageous. This tacit
        criticism is contained in verse 13: &quot;I can do all things in him who
        strengthens me.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It may be questioned, however, whether this
        translation is the best possible. If allowance be made for Greek idiom a
        new version may be ventured for the sake of locating the emphasis where
        it is needed: &quot;There is nothing I lack the power to do through him
        who puts his strength into me.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If now a moment may be spared for a rapid survey, we
        shall have discovered Paul to be reasoning at times after the fashion of
        Epicurus; we shall have observed the employment of certain words that
        are peculiar to the vocabularies of Epicurus and Paul; we shall have
        found several topics to have been illuminated for us by citation of the
        teachings of Epicurus; and in particular, we shall have found the
        euphonious verse beginning &quot;whatsoever things are true&quot; to be
        completely redeemed from its present vagueness by knowledge of Epicurean
        precepts.</p>
        <p align="justify">One item of information may also be mentioned for
        future reflection: Paul seems to display far too much affinity with the
        cheerful and friendly Epicureans to have ever been enamored of the
        censorious Stoics, who revered as their founder &quot;the sour and
        scowling Zeno.&quot;

        Epistle will be Peace and Safety we shall learn something worth while
        about Paul by calling Epicurus to testify concerning the question of
        honesty, which arises in First Thessalonians 2:1-8.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the Revised Standard it is made to begin:
        &quot;For you yourselves know, brethren, that our visit to you was not
        in vain.&quot; We believe this to be wrong and that this error has
        beclouded the interpretation and translation of the whole paragraph,
        which consequently calls for fresh scrutiny. We believe the true meaning
        to be, &quot;our visit to you was not a sham&quot; or a
        &quot;pretense.&quot; Paul will be found to be defending himself against
        the charge of duplicity, as he also does elsewhere.</p>
        <p align="justify">The clue to a correct interpretation, as often
        happens, may be found in a word that Paul shares with Epicurus. It is
        the verb <i>parresiazomai</i> (2:2), which in the New Testament occurs
        only in Acts and in two Pauline Epistles. In the Revised Standard it is
        rendered &quot;we had courage&quot; and in the best New Testament
        lexicon it is defined &quot;to speak freely or boldly, be bold in
        speech.&quot; This definition is not incorrect for classical Greek but
        in the philosophy of Epicurus the word was slightly deflected to signify
        &quot;speak with absolute frankness or truthfulness.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Absolute veracity was a fetish with Epicurus and, as
        usual, it was part of his structure of thought. His teachings were later
        amplified by the Epicurean Philodemus of Gadara under the title <i>On
        Frankness</i>, a work still extant in extensive fragments. From these
        may be gleaned much information on the topic of admonition, of which the
        Epicureans preceded Paul in making a specialty. It is likely that Paul
        knew the treatise at first hand.&nbsp; Even the teaching of Epicurus
        himself can be documented to a certain extent and it possesses intrinsic
        value, quite apart from the help it affords in arriving at Paul's
        meaning.</p>
        <p align="justify">As elsewhere mentioned in this study, Epicurus
        rejected the Platonic reason as the norm of truth and exalted Nature in
        its stead. Nature, he insisted, was honest herself and demanded honesty
        of her devotees. To be dishonest or untruthful was deemed unworthy of a
        student of natural phenomena; for a scientist to lie about his
        observations would be a sort of treason. This is implied in a saying of
        his: &quot;As for me, I should prefer to speak with absolute honesty, as
        befits the study of nature, and utter oracular sayings beneficial to all
        men, even if not a soul shall understand me, rather than, by falling
        into line with popular opinions, to reap the lush praise that falls from
        the favor of the multitude.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">With this contempt of popular favor Paul could fully
        concur and he reveals his feeling in this very paragraph, verse 6:
        &quot;nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from
        others.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In another saying Epicurus writes: &quot;I was never
        ambitious to please the multitude.&quot; In this same paragraph Paul
        writes, verse 4: &quot;so we speak, not to please men,&quot; though he
        makes the customary change of motivation, &quot;but to please God, who
        scrutinizes our hearts.&quot; This is characteristic of Paul's use of
        sentiments taken from Epicurus: he changes the motivation; in this
        instance he substitutes loyalty to God for loyalty to Nature, whom
        Epicurus the scientist revered as the supreme teacher.</p>
        <p align="justify">Still other echoes of Epicurus may be delved out of
        this engaging paragraph, which amply deserves to be redeemed from its
        present obscurity. However surprising it may seem to be, this man
        Epicurus, who was reputed to be an enemy of religion, shared with Jesus
        a reverence for little children. He did not, it is true, believe them to
        be born sinless, because the word <i>sin</i> was not in his vocabulary,
        but he did believe them to be born honest and sincere, though often
        defiled later by education. For example, if children should have been
        given such an education as to lead them to suppose that happiness was to
        be derived from wealth or fame, they would have been defiled. They would
        have erred from the truth and become unclean.</p>
        <p align="justify">The knowledge of this teaching will now enable us to
        apprehend the exact significance of verse 3 of our paragraph, which is
        decidedly vague in the Revised Standard: &quot;For our appeal does not
        spring from error or uncleanness.&quot; At a slight sacrifice of brevity
        this may be rendered precise by reading: &quot;For our appeal does not
        have its origin in an aberration from honesty or from impure
        motives.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If Paul had either sought favor by flattery or been
        possessed of a desire for gain which he sought to conceal, his motives
        would have been impure according to Epicurus, nor would he have been
        following the straight path of honesty. It is against these very
        imputations that Paul defends himself, in verse 5: &quot;For never did
        we use either words of flattery, as you know, or a cloak for gain.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus the helper may be invoked to assist in
        correcting still another error in this darkened paragraph, verse 7,
        which in the Revised Standard reads in part: &quot;But we were gentle
        among you, like a nurse taking care of her children.&quot; It is the
        word <i>gentle</i> that strikes a false note: the word <i>babes</i> has
        been used in its stead and is closer to the Greek. The key to the true
        meaning may be found in two items of Epicurean teaching: first, that
        children are honest unless spoiled, as already mentioned; and second,
        that the good teacher or nurse will also be honest, that is, actuated
        solely by the good of the child. Hence the meaning must be: &quot;But we
        came among you guileless as a child, just as a nurse is guileless in
        caring for the children given to her charge.&quot; The correctness of
        this is confirmed in verse 11, &quot;like a father with his
        children,&quot; the good father being free from self-interest and
        actuated solely by the good of the children.</p>
        <p align="justify">The pagan Epicurus, though a convinced celibate like
        Paul, displayed a keen discernment in matters of family life. The two
        men, in spite of the chasm that separated the logic of the atom from the
        logic of the cross, thought remarkably alike on domestic matters.</p>
        <p align="justify">Before assembling the corrections already made it
        remains to make a minor improvement in verses 6-7, which in the Revised
        Standard read in part as follows: &quot;nor did we seek glory from men,
        neither from you nor from others, though we might have made demands as
        apostles of Christ.&quot; It is this last clause that falls short of
        being precise.</p>
        <p align="justify">The key word of the Greek text is associated with
        vainglorious kings who pitch their voices low to impress their subjects
        and with pretentious actors who do the same in performing kingly roles.
        Epicurus used to twit the Platonists with putting on similar airs; in
        point of fact they bore the reputation of being the highsteppers among
        the philosophers. The last clause in the sentence above may consequently
        be rendered: &quot;though we might have assumed the grand manner as
        apostles of Christ.&quot; Paul means to say that he might well have made
        a bid for glory.</p>
        <p align="justify">It remains now to readjust our understanding of the
        whole paragraph in the light of these findings. Paul is manifestly
        defending himself against the charge of having been animated by
        self-interest. It is for this reason that the words &quot;our visit was
        not in vain&quot; must be changed to read &quot;our visit was not a
        sham.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It is equally necessary to emend the words that
        follow: &quot;we had courage in our God to declare to you the
        gospel.&quot; To mention courage is tempting in English but the Greeks
        did not call moral courage by the same name as physical courage. The
        question here is rather one of honesty or dishonesty, sincerity or
        pretense. The manhandling suffered by Paul at Philippi might have been
        thought to tempt him to appease the Thessalonicans by flattery; it
        might, he hints, have deflected him from that absolute honesty, which
        he, like Epicurus before him, esteemed to be of paramount consequence.
        What he writes may therefore be rendered more precisely: &quot;but
        notwithstanding the fact that in Philippi we had been assaulted and
        subjected to shameful indignities, as you well know, still, with the
        help of our God, we spoke the absolute truth in declaring to you the
        gospel of God under great stress.&quot;</p>

        Peace and Safety</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Among the numerous clues that serve to identify
        references to the Epicureans none is more specific and certain than the
        mention of their watchwords Peace and Safety. These occur in First
        Thessalonians 5:3, where the King James Version runs: &quot;For when
        they shall say, Peace and Safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon
        them.&quot; This falls far short of exactitude but it is superior to the
        Revised Standard: &quot;When people say, 'There is peace and security,'
        then sudden destruction will come upon them.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The unlucky change from &quot;when they shall
        say&quot; to &quot;when people say&quot; is based upon the gratuitous
        assumption that no particular group or sect is being singled out for
        censure but merely some section of the populace that refuses to be
        alarmed by the prediction of the second coming and the destruction of
        unbelievers. The perplexity of translators is due to the fact that
        catchwords of unmistakable reference in Paul's time have lost their
        significance through the lapse of the centuries.</p>
        <p align="justify">No person of ordinary intelligence at the date when
        the letter was written would have been ignorant that peace and safety
        were objectives of the Epicurean way of life. Recognition of this fact
        will enable us to correct the translation. To this end it must be
        remembered that the second coming and the destruction of unbelievers are
        events in the future but the threat is present and perpetual. With this
        knowledge kept well in mind we shall be able to set the tenses to
        rights: &quot;At the very moment that they are saying 'peace and safety'
        sudden destruction is hanging over them.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">When once this identification of the Epicureans has
        been made, confirmation will be the more certain in the seemingly
        innocent words (4:3), &quot;the others who have no hope.&quot; This
        signifies no hope of benefiting by the grace of God and the Epicureans
        were so characterized even outside of the New Testament by their rivals
        the Stoics, because they denied divine providence.</p>
        <p align="justify">Additional confirmation of a new and oblique sort
        will be found in the Second Epistle, 2:1-12, where the coming of
        Antichrist is predicted. It has long since been observed that the
        description admirably fits the character of the notorious Antiochus
        Epiphanes, king of Syria and persecutor of the Jews. What has not been
        so well known is the fact that this king became a convert to the creed
        of Epicurus and adopted it as the court philosophy. Thus the ominous
        inference is forced upon us that Epicureanism is to be associated with
        Antichrist.</p>
        <p align="justify">This outline of evidence will now be amplified.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Peace</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Any lingering doubt that peace was a watchword of the
        Epicureans may be set at rest by the testimony of St. Augustine, who at
        one time was tempted to become an adherent of the sect and long remained
        partial toward it. In one passage he characterized them by three words:
        Pleasure, Suavity, and Peace. It is quite true that he lived three
        centuries later than Paul but his word is still good for the earlier
        date; the creed of Epicurus was notorious for tenacity of doctrine.
        Later Epicureans, such as Philodemus, elaborated without altering the
        original teachings.</p>
        <p align="justify">It will be helpful to observe that Peace has been
        coupled with Pleasure and Suavity. The Epicureans were men of good will
        and urbanity, &quot;least of all malicious,&quot; as Cicero admitted.
        From the first they had taken care to differentiate themselves from the
        snarling Cynic philosophers, who went about insulting all and sundry and
        scorning the decencies of life; and not less from the Stoics, a
        censorious sect who condemned all pleasure and made a virtue of being
        disagreeable.</p>
        <p align="justify">This aversion from Cynics and Stoics, along with the
        emphasis upon good will and brotherly love, had its sequel later on in a
        marked similarity between Epicureans and Christians, embarrassing to
        Paul and repelling and attracting him alternately. He was also betrayed
        into inconsistency. For example, in these very Epistles to the
        Thessalonians he writes in the salutation, &quot;Grace to you and <i>peace,&quot;</i>
        and in 5:3 this same word is used with scorn when he writes &quot;peace
        and safety.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Furthermore, it is no formality when he adds,
        &quot;from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; It must never
        be overlooked that this salutation was an innovation. It was invented by
        Paul for Christian use. Epicurus himself, who instituted the custom of
        composing epistles for colonies of disciples, had shown himself an
        innovator in this regard. The usual Greek salutation was
        &quot;Rejoice,&quot; although it became so washed out with use as to
        mean no more than &quot;Dear Sir.&quot; Epicurus varied it by such
        heartening phrases as &quot;Live the good life&quot; or &quot;Put zest
        into living,&quot; it being his teaching that this life was the only
        life and should be enjoyed to the full.</p>
        <p align="justify">Now Paul, adopting the custom of composing epistles
        for colonies of converts, was confronted by the necessity of choosing a
        new salutation for his particular needs. Neither does it require any
        exceptional acumen to discern that he took a suggestion from the mammon
        of unrighteousness, as Jesus had recommended. Not that he copied
        Epicurus; he imitated his example only so far as his new salutation
        should be an expression of good will. In substance he was repudiating
        the example of Epicurus but the example that is repudiated may have even
        more influence over a man's choice than the example that is adopted. One
        item that Paul deliberately chose to write into the new salutation was
        the doctrine of grace, which Epicurus, by persistently denying the
        interest of the gods in human affairs, had rendered indispensable for a
        living religion.</p>
        <p align="justify">As for the word <i>peace</i> in Paul's salutation,
        the idea it embodied was incapable of being utterly different from the
        concept of peace according to Epicurus, who had won for it the status of
        a blessed aspiration in the public mind; what Paul did was to shift the
        idea to a new complex of meanings, adding something to its content and
        modifying the motivation. The peace of mind that was long associated
        with Epicurus is transformed into the peace of God. Here again,
        philosophy is in process of being supplanted by religion.</p>
        <p align="justify">A slight amplification will make this more clear.
        What especially repelled Paul was the claim of Epicurus that a man could
        achieve peace of mind by his own efforts. This is what Epicurus meant
        when he wrote: &quot;It is silly to pray to the gods for things that a
        man is capable of obtaining for himself.&quot; The poet Horace, who
        often quotes Epicurean doctrine exactly, has this to say: &quot;as for
        peace of mind, I'll provide that for myself.&quot; It is in opposition
        to this public teaching that Paul writes: &quot;Grace to you and peace
        from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In this connection still another point is worthy of
        mention. The disciples of Epicurus were known among themselves as
        &quot;Friends of Epicurus.&quot; It was natural, therefore, for the
        master to address his epistles, for example, <i>To the Friends in Asia.</i>
        Paul avoids this word friend as if ill-omened and writes instead, for
        example, <i>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ.</i> This too
        is a repudiation of Epicurus but it is also an imitation.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Peace in the Family</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">A close scrutiny of this topic of peace will increase
        our understanding of the New Testament, because the Epicureans had made
        intensive studies of the topic in advance of Paul and their findings
        were part of the public knowledge of his time.</p>
        <p align="justify">Peace of mind, to which the present study has been
        confined down to this point, was by Epicurus called <i>ataraxy,</i>
        which all our larger English dictionaries, copying one another,
        mistakenly define as &quot;stoical indifference,&quot; confusing it with
        apathy. The Stoics feared the emotions and cultivated indifference; the
        friendly Epicurus had no fear of emotions in general, which he regarded
        as normal, but only of disturbing emotions, such as fear of the gods and
        death and judgment after death. These, he believed, could all be
        dispelled by a true understanding of the constitution of the universe,
        which to his thinking was a vast self-operating mechanism, in which man
        alone was master of his fate, unbothered by interfering gods.</p>
        <p align="justify">It goes without saying that this frame of thought
        into which Epicurus had built this concept of peace was blasphemous to
        Paul's soul, nor could he demean himself by employing the word <i>ataraxy.</i>
        The Epicureans themselves, however, had made use of another word, <i>eirene,</i>
        to denote peace in the family and among neighbors. This more ordinary
        word is consequently made to serve in the Epistles, as in the New
        Testament generally, for both kinds of peace.</p>
        <p align="justify">This phenomenon of an Epicurean word being dropped
        while its meaning was transferred to another is not exceptional. The
        Epicureans exalted brotherly love under the name of <i>philia,</i> which
        is replaced in the New Testament by <i>agape,</i> meaning the same
        thing. Another instance of such substitution is the Christian word <i>catachumens,</i>
        which signifies pupils being prepared for baptism and confirmation. This
        was a mere translation of an Epicurean term <i>kataskeuazomenoi,</i>
        signifying pupils in a preparatory school, i.e., those not yet ready for
        full &quot;confirmation&quot; in the new way of life. Here again,
        Epicureanism may be seen as anticipating Christian procedures.</p>
        <p align="justify">The aspect of peace which stands closest to peace of
        mind, both being denoted by the same word in the New Testament, is peace
        within the family. Of this topic the Epicureans had made their usual
        studies and thereby obtained for certain homely virtues a status of
        importance which had been denied them by Plato, who confined his
        attention to political virtues, especially justice. The very word that
        to Plato signified justice must be rendered righteousness in the New
        Testament and this is typical of the shift of interest from political
        toward social virtues, to which Epicurus gave a powerful impulse.</p>
        <p align="justify">It may be readily allowed that the study of the
        social virtues became a general trend among the philosophers who
        followed Plato in point of time, but Epicurus and his successors were
        singular among them in being conscious of the mission of promoting human
        happiness. Theirs was the only missionary philosophy produced by the
        Greeks. Their attitude was pragmatic; they were interested in practical
        problems of conduct. Consequently it was quite natural that they should
        adopt their own characteristic scheme of arrangement in their treatment
        of virtues.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was their choice to draw up lists of &quot;vices
        and the corresponding virtues.&quot; In this there is a sound logic; the
        vice can be defined only as the opposite of the virtue. Without the
        vice, the corresponding virtue would possess no meaning. For example, if
        we could imagine a society in which there was not a single liar, then
        there would be no praise for truthfulness; it would cease to be a
        virtue.</p>
        <p align="justify">This device of opposing the vice to the virtue was
        taken over by Paul without any concealment; his attitude toward religion
        was no less pragmatic than that of Epicurus toward philosophy. The truth
        is that he elaborates the device and incorporates it with amazing
        ingenuity into his new spiritual structure of doctrine. It is such
        elaboration that we should discern in the closing passage of Galatians,
        where he discourses upon &quot;the desires of the Spirit&quot; and
        &quot;the desires of the flesh,&quot; and &quot;the works of the
        Spirit&quot; and &quot;the works of the flesh.&quot; No small part of
        the charm of First Corinthians 13 depends upon the use of this ethical
        counterpoint as a literary expedient: &quot;Love is patient and kind;
        love is <i>not</i> jealous or boastful; it is <i>not</i> arrogant or
        rude.&quot; A veritable garland of examples is found in this passage.</p>
        <p align="justify">While other examples may be garnered from various
        Epistles, the particular virtues that make for peace and harmony in
        family life receive chief emphasis in the closing passages of Ephesians
        and Colossians, where Paul offers wise counsel to husbands, wives,
        children, slaves, and masters. More awaits to be said when these
        Epistles come under discussion; here it will suffice to call attention
        to the list of vices that mar the peace of the family and the community
        -- anger, wrath, malice, slander, and foul talk -- and the opposing
        virtues that make for peace -- compassion, kindness, lowliness,
        meekness, and patience.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is always well to pause for a surveying glance:
        here it may occur to the mind how easily a good Epicurean family might
        have become a good Christian family; their codes of morals were very
        similar; the structure of doctrine needed to be changed, as also the
        motivation, but not the precepts.</p>

        Safety</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">No external evidence need be adduced to certify the
        status of safety as a watchword of the Epicureans. The word itself
        occurs in four of the forty Authorized Doctrines of the founder and the
        idea behind it is elaborated in at least five others.</p>
        <p align="justify">The teaching there embodied possesses singular
        importance because it can be traced down through history to the
        Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution. This
        influence has completely escaped the acumen of historians, just as the
        influence of Epicurus upon Paul has escaped the notice of New Testament
        scholars, and for this reason a brief glance at the story may be
        justified.</p>
        <p align="justify">Plato had devoted the greater part of his thought to
        the topic of justice, which to the Greeks was almost synonymous with
        government<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        and arrived at the conclusion that citizens should be
        tightly controlled in a closed society resembling modern communistic
        states. Epicurus, always hostile to Plato, advocated an open society
        with a minimum of government.</p>
        <p align="justify">He rejected the Platonic dialectic as a means of
        discovering truth and set up Nature as the teacher. To discover what
        justice really is, he asserted, it is sufficient to observe a herd of
        wild animals, elephants probably preferred. They do not injure one
        another and they organize themselves to protect one another. This is
        &quot;the justice of Nature,&quot; and he condensed it to one sentence
        in Authorized Doctrine 31: &quot;The justice of Nature is a covenant of
        advantage to the end that men shall not injure one another nor be
        injured.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Safety to him, therefore, signified the security of
        the individual against injury to his person, assuming that this would be
        useless unless his property were also protected. John Locke took over
        this idea from Epicurus but he dared not mention the alleged enemy of
        religion as his source, because he was writing in the age of the
        Puritans. He also disguised the principle by reversing it; he declared
        the function of government to be the protection of the property of the
        citizen, assuming it to be useless to protect his property unless his
        person were also protected.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thomas Jefferson, however, one of the few men with
        courage to avow himself an Epicurean, reversed this reversal; the words
        he wrote into the Declaration of Independence were not &quot;property,
        liberty, and the pursuit of wealth&quot; but &quot;life, liberty, and
        the pursuit of happiness,&quot; veritable watchwords of Epicureanism.</p>
        <p align="justify">If this little digression shall have enhanced our
        respect for Epicurus, we may feel less reluctance to recognize the
        evidences of his reasonings in the thought of Paul.</p>
        <p align="justify">The fact that safety was a catchword in Paul's time,
        even apart from the writings of Epicurus, is amply evidenced by the
        policy of the Roman government under which he lived. This government was
        earning a singular fame for itself by the fidelity with which it
        undertook to protect the persons of its citizens. The lengths to which
        it was willing to go to this end, if once appealed to, is exemplified by
        the protection afforded Paul himself when attacked in Jerusalem. He was
        furnished an escort of seventy horsemen all the way to Caesarea and an
        additional guard of four hundred infantry for the more dangerous stage
        of the journey ( Acts 23:23 and 32).</p>
        <p align="justify">On this topic of safety and the Roman government
        something may yet be added. The assurance of safety and peace was
        denoted by the word <i>securitas</i> and this began to become a
        catchword in Cicero's lifetime. A century later, in the days of Nero,
        under whom Paul was martyred, it received full recognition and began to
        appear upon imperial coins as a deity, <i>SECURITAS.</i></p>

        Paul and Safety</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Paul's attitude toward the problem of personal safety
        was not the same at all periods of his ministry and deserves to be
        traced. It will turn out to be very different from that of Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">In his earlier ministry it is doubtful whether Paul
        could have spoken contemptuously of safety, as he did in First
        Thessalonians 5:3. It can hardly be doubted that the question of safety
        was a factor in deterring him from entering Bithynia and the Roman
        province of Asia ( Acts 16:6-7). Quite rightly he judged that the safest
        place for him was a synagogue or at least a place of prayer, as at
        Philippi ( Acts 16:13), because both Greeks and Romans were tolerant of
        foreign religions so long as adherents confined their activities to
        premises of their own. Again, when forced to leave Philippi, he decided
        it was prudent not to stop at Amphipolis and Apollonia, going instead to
        Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue ( Acts 17:1).</p>
        <p align="justify">At this stage of his experience Paul was still
        allowing his friends to make decisions for him. It was they who spirited
        him out of Thessalonica and later out of Beroea ( Acts 17:10 and 14-15),
        furnishing him an escort to Athens.</p>
        <p align="justify">This episode of Paul's visit to Athens falls under
        this topic of safety, though its significance has become obscured by the
        belief that he spoke on Mars' Hill. This hill is almost three hundred
        feet above the market place and distant a good half-hour's walk by a
        steep climb. No plausible reason can be discovered for such an effort
        having been demanded of the apostle.</p>
        <p align="justify">Mars' Hill is an unfortunate translation of the Greek
        word Areopagus, which was also the name of a court and a courtroom. What
        happened was that the philosophers escorted Paul into this courtroom,
        which was close by the spot where he had been speaking. He was under
        suspicion. In the synagogue he had been free to speak as he pleased but
        to become &quot;a preacher of foreign divinities&quot; in public was to
        invite trouble.</p>
        <p align="justify">Similarly, when he had finished the recorded speech
        in the courtroom, the words of Acts 17:32, &quot;We will hear you again
        about this,&quot; were an unveiled threat, a virtual adjournment of the
        hearing. This was the interpretation placed upon the words by Paul and
        he went on to Corinth &quot;in much fear and trembling,&quot; in spite
        of the original plan to await the arrival of Silas and Timothy.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is consequently manifest that only gradually the
        conviction forced itself upon Paul that to pursue safety and to preach
        the gospel were incompatible. This meant the discovery of the merit that
        lay in the suffering of persecution, a discovery that Jesus had made
        before him. It forced Paul to the decision that he would not avail
        himself of the protection due to him as a Roman citizen. Had he not
        reached this decision, there would have been no need for him to submit
        five times to flogging under Jewish law, much less to three scourgings
        with rods under Roman law, of which we learn in Second Corinthians
        11:24-25.</p>
        <p align="justify">It followed that by the compulsion of experience he
        was forced to adopt one policy for himself and recommend another for his
        converts. As a first consideration of safety he urged upon the latter
        obedience to the law, as in Romans 13:1: &quot;Let every person be
        subject to the governing authorities.&quot; As for himself, he was
        convinced that his status as a preacher of the gospel would be impaired
        by the pursuit of safety and this status enhanced by submission to
        persecution. Had he regularly exercised his right to appeal to Rome for
        protection, he could no longer have boasted as he does in Second
        Corinthians 11:21-27.</p>
        <p align="justify">It may be added that when on trial before Festus he
        said, &quot;I appeal to Caesar,&quot; it was not safety he sought or
        justice; it was the opportunity of going to Rome in custody, which
        seemed to be the only feasible way of satisfying his desire to visit
        that city.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Epicurus and Safety</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The ultimate attitude of Epicurus toward personal
        safety was also founded upon experience of persecution but it was his
        choice to pursue safety as a policy, which renders understandable the
        scorn of Paul. This scorn became the more justified in later days, after
        persecutions had become frequent, and St. Basil is referring to
        Epicureans without naming them when he writes somewhat icily of those
        &quot;who place a higher value upon nothing than upon truth and
        safety.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus, of course, lived and died before the
        eastern Mediterranean had come under Roman rule and his precepts were
        framed for the Greek world to which he belonged. As a primary assurance
        of safety he recommended to his disciples, just as Paul did later, to be
        obedient to the laws of the land.</p>
        <p align="justify">The courts of law, he well knew, though ostensibly
        existing for the sake of justice, were only too often employed as an
        agency of envy to rob the rich of their wealth, politicians of their
        power, and famous men of their prestige. The obscure citizen was the
        safest. It was consequently his general advice &quot;to live and die
        unknown,&quot; and in particular &quot;to shun the political
        career.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">To round off the picture of society as he knew it, we
        should also remember that except in the largest cities there was no
        police protection. Each individual was responsible for his own safety.
        To this end Epicurus exalted friendship as the surest guarantee. The
        making of friends was too important to be left to chance. In one of his
        Authorized Doctrines he recommended &quot;to make all relationships
        friendly where possible; where this was not possible, to render them at
        least not unfriendly; and where not even this was possible, to avoid
        contacts.&quot; It was to avoid contacts that he confined his teaching
        to his garden in Athens.</p>
        <p align="justify">In spite of this systematic pursuit of safety, the
        good Epicurean was not by any means a shameless sponsor of safety at any
        price. Long before Jesus is reported to have said, &quot;Greater love
        hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his
        friends,&quot; Epicurus had written: &quot;The wise man will on occasion
        die for a friend.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This view was reasoned out in a characteristic way,
        which may be read in another saying: &quot;Nothing can be terrible to a
        man while living if there is nothing terrible to him in not
        living.&quot; In other words, if a man has no fear of death, because it
        is an eternity of unconsciousness, neither will he fear the tyrant or
        his torture. In yet another saying, this Epicurus, whom a great scholar
        has seen fit to disparage as a &quot;moral invalid,&quot; anticipates
        the resolution of the Christian martyr: &quot;The wise man, even on the
        rack, is a happy man.&quot;</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Epicurean and Pauline Admonition</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">It is both astonishing and informing to discover Paul
        adopting the procedures of the capable but irritating Epicureans in this
        same fifth chapter of the first Epistle to the Thessalonians which
        begins with the prediction of their destruction. We should observe and
        keep in mind his addiction to the words <i>admonish</i> and <i>admonition.</i>
        Except for one example in Acts, these are confined to the Epistles of
        Paul and with the Epicureans they were technical. The sect made a
        specialty of ethical instruction, which they styled &quot;a many-sided
        art.&quot; By <i>admonition</i> was meant &quot;suggestion&quot; or
        &quot;correction without blame or reprimand.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Over and above the friendly and uncondemning tone,
        which Paul in Ephesians 4:15 calls &quot;speaking the truth in
        love&quot;<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>–</span>
        we
        should observe also the content of the advice and exhortation. A few
        parallels between Paul's advice and that of Epicurus may be presented
        item by item.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus planned that his philosophy of life should
        be independent of tutors, extending itself by mutual instruction and
        admonition. Paul writes, verse 11: &quot;Therefore encourage one another
        and build one another up, just as you are doing.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus urged the value of reverence, &quot;a great
        good to the one who feels the reverence,&quot; especially reverence for
        those more advanced in wisdom. Paul writes, verse 12: &quot;And we
        beseech you, brethren, to respect those who labor among you and are over
        you in the Lord and admonish you.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It is true that Epicurus saw little value in prayer
        but he did declare that continuous happiness was possible and he exalted
        the virtue of gratitude to first rank as a factor of happiness. Verse 16
        is therefore partly Epicurean, partly exclusively Pauline: &quot;Rejoice
        always, pray constantly, give thanks under all circumstances.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If doubt exists that Paul in this Epistle had
        Epicurean admonition in mind, this can be dispelled by his warning about
        &quot;quenching the Spirit.&quot; This was the effect, as he pondered
        the matter, of &quot;despising prophecy.&quot; To understand this it is
        necessary to recall the statement of Cicero concerning Epicurus:
        &quot;There was nothing he ridiculed so much as the prediction of future
        events.&quot; Hence 5:19 and 20: &quot;Quench not the Spirit. Despise
        not prophesyings.&quot;&nbsp; To ridicule the prediction of the second
        coming in particular was to Paul's way of thinking &quot;quenching the
        Spirit.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The clue to the last item in this list is the most
        likely of all to escape detection. Epicurus made a cardinal virtue of
        total honesty. Of the wise man, who corresponds to the saint in
        Christian thought, he writes that &quot;he will be the same in his
        slumbers.&quot; Even in sleep, when the evil in human nature is prone to
        reassert itself, the truly good man will be the same as in waking hours.
        Is this not the meaning of Paul when he writes in verse 10: &quot;so
        that whether we wake or sleep we might live with him&quot;? What was
        total honesty to Epicurus becomes in Paul's structure of ethic total
        sanctification.</p>
        <p align="justify">A momentous addition, however, remains to be made.
        The diligent student of Paul's thought may have observed a minor device
        of his writing: in a casual way he drops the hint of a certain sentiment
        and after an interval returns to it with amplification. In this instance
        the hint may be discerned in verse 10, quoted above, and the
        amplification is found in verse 23, next to the last, a fitting climax
        to this ladder of admonition. Total sanctification, the substitute for
        the total honesty of Epicurus, is the theme: &quot;May the God of peace
        himself sanctify you <i>wholly;</i> and may your spirits and your souls
        be preserved <i>in their integrity</i> and your bodies be guarded <i>blamelessly</i>
        at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The above translation is our own. We regret at all
        times to depart from the euphonious words of the King James or other
        versions but for the present study the objective is precision. Perhaps
        it may be possible at times to obtain euphony also.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this chapter we see in closer combination than
        elsewhere the repulsion and the attraction of Epicureanism, the ridicule
        of divine events that repelled and the kindly ethic that attracted. Paul
        builds upon the latter while vigorously condemning the former. He may be
        discerned in the very process of transforming an Epicurean community
        into a Christian community and Greek philosophy into the Christian
        religion, replacing, for example, the virtue of total honesty by the
        virtue of total sanctification.</p>
        <p align="justify">The astonishing thing is the absence of mention of
        teachings of Jesus. This, however, becomes less astonishing when we
        recall that the Gospels were not yet available. It is not even certain,
        it may even be improbable, that Paul was familiar with the sayings of
        Jesus; he does not reason in the way that Jesus did nor teach after the
        manner of his teaching. It is certain, on the contrary, that he knew the
        precepts of Epicurus and how to reason after his fashion. This will be
        amply demonstrated in the study of First Corinthians.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the meantime we may pause to discern two distinct
        stages in the progress of Christian education, the first being based
        upon the sermons and Epistles of Paul, the next being based also upon
        Gospels, both those we possess and others that are lost, which must have
        been compiled for the express purpose of supplying the texts of
        instruction that were previously lacking. The Epicureans, on the
        contrary, had long been furnished with suitable textbooks and not
        unnaturally Paul drew upon these for his material, both because they
        were familiar to his Greek converts and because they were familiar to
        himself.</p>

        Epicurus and Antichrist</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">In the second Epistle to the Thessalonians the main
        topic is the second coming. The prophecy of this event seems to have
        given rise to two parties who occasioned vexation to Paul and the other
        apostles: first, those who were prone to believe or easily incited to
        believe that the coming was imminent; and second, those who teased and
        bantered the Christians about the delay in the coming.</p>
        <p align="justify">The teasers were the Epicureans. A well-reasoned
        caution against their activities may be found in Second Peter 3. The
        reasoning of Paul to the same end is less happy. He explains that the
        rebellion must come first and the man of lawlessness be revealed, who
        for the time being is being restrained. This is Antichrist, though the
        name is not used.</p>
        <p align="justify">The concept of Antichrist, though of course not the
        name, was Jewish and oriental and hardly a fruitful one for the
        Christian tradition. It gave rise to protracted and useless speculation
        concerning the identity of &quot;the man of lawlessness.&quot; It
        deserves consideration in this present study, however, because the
        description of the monster fits so admirably the known character of the
        notorious Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria from 174 to 167 B.C., who
        was a convert to Epicureanism.</p>
        <p align="justify">His conversion to this creed became known through the
        publication of a mutilated papyrus document some fifty years ago but the
        information so revealed has not as yet been recognized as possessing a
        bearing upon the New Testament story.</p>
        <p align="justify">According to this papyrus a learned Epicurean
        philosopher named Philonides resolved to make a convert of the king and
        began to ply him with letters and pamphlets. This campaign was crowned
        with success. Philonides was welcomed to the royal court in Antioch and
        assigned a residence across the square from the palace; this seems to
        have been ample for housing &quot;a throng of scholars,&quot; who
        accompanied him.</p>
        <p align="justify">These honors seem to have been fully deserved. The
        new favorite was employed as ambassador, and decrees in his honor have
        been found carved on stone at Athens and Delphi. He was later appointed
        to the governorship of a city. As a scholar he was enterprising. He
        published more than a hundred books, among them an edition of the
        letters of Epicurus and his chief collaborators; he also busied himself
        with collecting the writings of the Epicureans for the royal library.</p>
        <p align="justify">These facts possess tremendous interest for the
        reason that they inform us of Antioch's having been an outstanding
        center of Epicureanism long before it became a center of Christianity.
        It was there, as Luke informs us in Acts 11:26, that the disciples of
        Jesus were first called Christians. Neither can much doubt exist that
        this name was coined for them to distinguish them from the disciples of
        Epicurus. We should bear steadily in mind that these two sects were
        singular in being named for their founders. We should also bear in mind
        that the disciples of Epicurus did not call one another Epicureans and
        the disciples of Jesus did not call themselves Christians. These names
        were coined by outsiders, possibly by members of the Roman colony in
        Antioch.</p>
        <p align="justify">The information about Antioch possesses the more
        interest because this king Antiochus made himself the archenemy of the
        Jews. His very title Epiphanes, which means &quot;god manifest,&quot;
        must have been odious to them, and he incurred their everlasting
        detestation by invading Judea and endeavoring to force Greek culture
        upon them. Neither can it be doubted, in view of his known conversion to
        Epicureanism, that his name was associated with this hated philosophy.</p>
        <p align="justify">The inference is consequently justified that Paul,
        knowing the history of his race, could hardly have penned a description
        befitting Antiochus without thinking at the same time of Epicureanism.</p>

        </font><font face="Arial" size="3">Scoffers in the Last Days</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The assumption that the ridicule which aroused the
        indignation of Paul, as recorded in the Epistles to the Thessalonians,
        stemmed from the Epicureans meets with welcome and definite confirmation
        outside the Pauline writings in Second Peter 3, where the faithful are
        urged to &quot;remember the predictions of the holy prophets.&quot;
        Verse 3 reads in part: &quot;First of all you must understand this, that
        scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">But how, it may well be asked, can we be sure that
        these scoffers are to be identified as the disciples of Epicurus? In
        this instance the evidences are unusually abundant and follow hard upon
        one another.</p>
        <p align="justify">The verse quoted in part above ends with these words,
        &quot;following their own passions.&quot; This is slightly misleading
        and the King James even more so, &quot;walking after their own
        lusts.&quot; It would be more exact to read, &quot;walking according to
        their own desires.&quot; The point is that the sect of Epicurus stood
        out among all others as repudiating service or subjection to any divine
        being. It was they who above all others asserted the independence of
        man, who must be free to plan his whole life, uninhibited by fear of
        fate, fortune, or divine being; in their creed there was only scorn for
        such an injunction as &quot;Thy will be done.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus even went so far as to think of man as
        emancipated from the rule of the laws of nature. In a universe dominated
        by natural law, according to him, man alone was exempt. The very atoms,
        he taught, swerved from their courses to allow him freedom of choice. He
        was free to choose evil and free to choose the good, because the gods
        were indifferent to human wickedness. Hence Epicureans are rightly
        described as &quot;walking according to their own desires.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Now let us look at what follows. What do these
        scoffers say? They ask a question: &quot;Where is the promise of his
        coming?&quot; This is particularly revealing. The bantering question had
        been a specialty of Epicurus himself and he incurred persecution because
        of his skill at it. His disciples perpetuated the tradition. In Acts
        17:18 they did not say that Paul was talking nonsense; they asked
        instead: &quot;What would this babbler say?&quot; In First Corinthians
        15:35 it was they who demanded to know: &quot;How are the dead raised?
        With what kind of body do they come?&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">There is more to be said, however. This very form of
        question is in the Greek language an idiom of teasing, derision, or even
        defiance. Paul himself resorts to the use of it in First Corinthians
        1:20, retorting to his enemies with their own weapons: &quot;Where is
        the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this
        age?&quot; The Greeks had been saying that the word of the cross was
        foolishness. By the form of his retort Paul is replying that the wisdom
        of the Greeks is foolishness. More will be written on this topic in the
        study of First Corinthians.</p>
        <p align="justify">Meanwhile let us return to the evidence, which is
        piling up. What more do these scoffers say? The taunting question was
        equivalent to a declaration that the prediction of the second coming and
        the destruction of unbelievers was foolishness, and the reason is given
        as follows: &quot;For ever since the fathers fell asleep all things
        continue as they are from the beginning of creation.&quot; This means
        that the world is eternal and not destined to destruction and it
        definitely recalls the doctrine enunciated by Epicurus himself:
        &quot;The universe has always been the same as it now is and always will
        be the same.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This declaration embodies the first two of the Twelve
        Elementary Principles of Physics, which Epicurus required his disciples
        to learn by heart: the first declares that matter is uncreatable and the
        second that matter is indestructible. Epicurus knew nothing of the Book
        of Genesis but unwittingly repudiated it. The first words of Genesis
        are: &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and earth.&quot;
        Epicurus had written &quot;Of atoms and space there is no beginning,
        because they are eternal.&quot; Chaos was inconceivable to him, because
        the universe had always been an orderly cosmos.</p>
        <p align="justify">So far, so good, but does the author of Second Peter
        reveal knowledge of the atoms? Beyond doubt he does and, like Paul, he
        calls them elements, which is a recognized synonym. Epicurus had
        described the atoms as hard, impenetrable, and indestructible, capable
        of surviving all dissolutions of compound bodies. The author of Peter's
        Epistle retorts that God created the world and destroyed it once with
        water; on the occasion of the second coming he will destroy it with fire
        and, verse 10, &quot;the elements will be dissolved with fire.&quot; He
        even chooses to repeat himself in verse 12, &quot;the elements will melt
        with fire.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The scorn of the writer for the Epicurean theory of
        the eternity of the universe may be better appreciated if an ancient
        error of translation be corrected, which still appears in the Revised
        Standard: &quot;the heavens will pass away with a loud noise.&quot;
        Unluckily for this version the sound denoted by the Greek word may be
        written &quot;Psst!&quot; or &quot;Pfft!&quot; This means that so great
        is the power of God that this universe, which the Epicureans declare to
        be eternal, will be blotted out at the word of God with the sound as of
        a squib.</p>
        <p align="justify">If now we pause to reflect upon the findings of these
        recent pages, it must become manifest what a turmoil of feeling the name
        of Epicurus was capable of arousing in the mind of Paul. If Luke knew
        that the disciples of Christ were first called Christians in Antioch,
        then Paul would also have known it; and if this name was coined for them
        to distinguish them from the disciples of Epicurus, then he must have
        been aware that to the populace of Antioch and to others who adopted the
        new names a particular rivalry was recognized between the sect of
        Epicurus and the followers of Christ, and by virtue of this fact
        Epicurus had become a sort of Antichrist. Moreover, the name of Epicurus
        must certainly have shot into the mind of Paul whenever he recalled the
        violence practiced upon his race by the notorious Antiochus, the
        generous patron of Epicureanism.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the progress of this study we shall in due time
        discover other reasons for the conflicting emotions of Paul and in
        particular the attractiveness of the Epicurean ethic as opposed to its
        shocking theology.

        The Weak and Beggarly Elements</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4">I</font><font size="2">F WE</font> study the writings of
        Paul with the proper clues and evidences in our minds, we shall find him
        in certain passages reasoning after the fashion of the Jews and in
        others after the fashion of the Greeks, and for the most part after the
        manner of Epicurus. When he reasons like a Jew, he is less appealing and
        less convincing.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this Epistle to the fickle Galatians, for example,
        he forges a chain of arguments to convince the members of the church of
        their spiritual sonship in Abraham. If, however, it was necessary for
        the Galatians to become conscious of this sonship, a like necessity
        should exist in the religious experience of the modern Christian, but
        this is not true, nor can any reasoning make it seem to be true. Thus
        the whole argument becomes gratuitous and for that reason devoid of
        interest to all except a few professional scholars.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the last two of the six chapters, on the contrary,
        Paul begins to reason like a Greek and an Epicurean and the interest of
        the modern reader is pricked and his attention challenged. These two
        chapters possess also a merited preference as devotional readings.</p>
        <p align="justify">In spite, however, of this difference, the previous
        four chapters contain precious items of evidence for our present studies
        of Paul's thought.</p>
        <p align="justify">For instance, verse 4:3, which is rendered in the
        Revised Standard, &quot;So with us; when we were children, we were
        slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe,&quot; may be more
        rightly interpreted to mean: &quot;when we were juveniles, we were
        slaves to the elements of the universe.&quot; The inference is that the
        Galatians, before they became Christians, had been Epicureans and
        believers in the atomic theory. The word <i>elements</i> is a synonym
        for <i>atoms.</i></p>
        <p align="justify">There is evidence also that the fickle Galatians were
        backsliding and reverting to the creed of Epicurus, as in verse 4:9:
        &quot;how can you turn back to the weak and beggarly elemental
        spirits,&quot; which should be rendered &quot;weak and beggarly
        elements,&quot; meaning the despised atoms.</p>
        <p align="justify">Again, when Paul writes in the verse following:
        &quot;You observe days, and months, and seasons, and years,&quot; these
        words can be explained in terms of the last will and testament of
        Epicurus. In this document, which is extant, the philosopher enjoins
        upon his followers the regular observances of a number of festivals,
        ceremonies, and anniversaries.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the two closing chapters it will not be surprising
        to discover items of Epicurean doctrine, because it is in the concluding
        exhortations of Paul that we customarily find them. Kindly admonition
        was a specialty of the friendly sect and Paul's partiality for it is
        first-rate evidence of his knowledge of its source.</p>
        <p align="justify">Details of this topic of admonition will be furnished
        in due course as this outline of the Epistle is amplified. In the
        meantime two items may be cited: first, the concept of freedom, as in
        5:1, &quot;For freedom Christ has set us free,&quot; which was taken
        over from Greek philosophy to become a blessed idea in the Christian
        experience; and second, the Epicurean scheme of instruction which
        opposes &quot;the vice to the corresponding virtue.&quot; This was
        adopted and adapted by Paul; the vices become &quot;the desires of the
        flesh&quot; and the virtues become &quot;the desires of the
        Spirit.&quot;</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Epicureanism in Asia</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The assumption that great numbers of the Galatians
        had been converted to Epicureanism is quite consistent with our
        knowledge of the creed. It was from its very inception a missionary
        philosophy and equipped with a self-propagating principle. Its members
        were famous for their persuasiveness<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        &quot;beguiling speech,&quot; as
        one version styles it<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>–</span>
        and upon them all was laid the injunction,
        &quot;omit no opportunity to disseminate the sayings of the true
        philosophy.&quot; Moreover, the creed flourished especially in the
        middle levels of society, the bourgeois class, who were engaged in
        trade, so that wherever merchants fared the doctrines would be
        disseminated. It was abundantly furnished with handbooks for every need
        and no tutors were necessary.</p>
        <p align="justify">If the upper classes in some parts of Galatia were
        barbarians to the Greeks, even this fact is no obstacle to believing
        them to have become Epicureans. Cicero, writing a century before the
        time of Paul, represents one of his speakers in a dialogue as saying of
        Epicurus, not without a touch of scorn: &quot;Illustrious philosopher,
        who caused a sensation not only in Greece and Italy but also in the
        whole barbarian world.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This information will gain force by amplification.
        Asia Minor was the only country with barbaric inhabitants that Cicero
        knew at first hand. As a young man he had visited the coastal cities and
        in his middle age he had been governor of Cilicia, the native land of
        Paul. Yet this is not the whole story; for many years he enjoyed the
        status of friend, patron, guest, and host of Deiotarus, king of Galatia,
        and a speech delivered on his behalf is still extant. It is consequently
        highly probable that his testimony concerning the popularity of
        Epicureanism among barbarians had been in large part derived from
        information gleaned from this king Deiotarus, who was a man of superior
        intelligence and abilities.</p>
        <p align="justify">Neither should it be cause for hesitation that the
        cities of Galatia were not notable for their number, size, or
        importance, the prevailing economy being agricultural and tending toward
        large estates. When the biographer wrote of &quot;the friends of
        Epicurus,&quot; for by this title his disciples were known, &quot;so
        many in multitude as not to be counted by whole cities,&quot; his
        meaning was that the creed was flourishing also in villages and country
        districts, which was possible for the reason that dissemination was from
        individual to individual and family to family and not by schools and
        tutors.</p>
        <p align="justify">To this it may be added that Epicurus himself had
        written &quot;the wise man will love country life&quot; and the
        Epicurean Philodemus of Gadara published a handbook, still extant in
        fragments, entitled <i>On the Management of an Estate</i>, in which he
        advised the prospective purchaser of a country property to make sure
        that he should have Epicurean neighbors, for the sake of good
        companionship. He was taking it for granted that this was possible.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is also to the point to bear in mind that Galatia
        was closer to sources of Epicureanism than it was at a later time to the
        sources of Christianity. If the creed had invaded the country from the
        north, this would have been from Lampsacus on the Hellespont, where
        Epicurus had resided and taught for upwards of four years, 310-306 B.C.,
        and left a flourishing school. One of his letters, the forerunners of
        the Epistles of Paul, was entitled <i>To the Friends in Lampsacus.</i></p>
        <p align="justify">It must have been from this center that the friendly
        philosophy extended itself along the string of cities bordering the
        Black Sea. One of these was Amastris in Bithynia, the population of
        which in the time of Marcus Aurelius was excommunicated from the use of
        an oracle of Apollo because the citizens were disciples of Epicurus and
        ridiculed prophecy. It is an interesting detail of this story that the
        impostor who managed the oracle complained of the Epicureans overrunning
        the country.</p>
        <p align="justify">There is, however, an item of evidence about
        Epicureanism in those parts that is dated three centuries earlier.
        Shortly before 90 B.C. a brilliant disciple of Epicurus known as
        Asclepiades emigrated from Prusa, close to the borders of Galatia, and
        established himself in Rome, where he practiced medicine for fifty
        years, becoming the outstanding physician of the century.</p>
        <p align="justify">If all these items be added together we may the
        better understand Paul's decision against entering, Bithynia, as
        recorded in Acts 16:7. The reason there given is the veto of the Spirit
        of Jesus, which need not discourage us from speculating concerning the
        reason for the veto itself.</p>
        <p align="justify">The condition most favorable to Paul's ministry at
        this stage of his activity would have been the presence of Jewish
        residents, the existence of synagogues, and a colony of Christian
        converts, because it was his custom to speak in the synagogues and it
        was his special talent to develop and confirm an existent church. When,
        therefore, we read that Paul and his companions &quot;attempted to go
        into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them,&quot; we
        shall be guilty of no irreverence if this be taken to mean: &quot;They
        explored the advisability of going into Bithynia and found out by
        inquiry that the Epicureans were strong and no friends were known with
        whom they could find lodging and hospitality.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This inference seems justified by the call to which
        Paul subsequently hearkened: &quot;Come over into Macedonia and help
        us.&quot; It must have been the lack of such a call that deterred the
        party from entering Bithynia.</p>
        <p align="justify">It will be worth our while to observe how admirably
        Epicureanism was equipped for the penetration of Asia. As mentioned
        already, the branch school at Lampsacus was strategically situated for
        the dissemination of the creed along the coast of the Black Sea.</p>
        <p align="justify">On the west coast of Asia there was another school at
        Mytilene, opposite the Roman province of Asia, from which, according to
        Acts 16:6, Paul was forbidden by the Holy Spirit. Still further to the
        south was the original school at Colophon, close to Ephesus. Both of
        these schools were excellently situated for the extension of the creed
        to the eastward, including Galatia, because the roads leading inland
        from the coastal cities were numerous.</p>
        <p align="justify">As for the southern parts of Asia Minor, if we try to
        conjure up a synoptic view, we shall see Christianity at a later time
        disseminating itself northward through Tarsus into the hinterlands, of
        which Galatia was one. Tarsus was in Cilicia and Paul in this Epistle to
        the Galatians, 1: 21 and 2:1, informs us that he spent fourteen years in
        the regions of Cilicia and Syria.</p>
        <p align="justify">This gateway to Asia, however, had been open to the
        creed of Epicurus for three centuries before Paul's time and Tarsus was
        a center of Epicureanism. In the second century B.C. a renegade
        Epicurean had made himself a tyrant of the city and ruled it for a time.
        In the same century a famous Epicurean philosopher named Diogenes had
        flourished there; his writings on the doctrines of Epicurus were in
        circulation for centuries. Meanwhile, Epicureanism was the court
        philosophy at Antioch during the reigns of at least two kings of Syria,
        Antiochus Epiphanes and Demetrius Soter.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus the same metropolitan centers from which
        Christianity was disseminated in the first century had been centers of
        dissemination for Epicureanism during the previous three centuries; and
        the dusty highways which radiated from these centers had been traversed
        by the friends of Epicurus with the handbooks of the master in their
        wallets long before the ardent company of Paul came plodding along those
        same routes on their hired mules.</p>
        <p align="justify">At this point a plea for suspension of judgment is in
        order. Whether these novel interpretations of ours will meet with
        acceptance or not should not depend exclusively upon the degree of
        finality with which each particular one can be justified, but rather
        upon the aggregate probability with which the influence of Epicurus upon
        Paul can be established. The part will not stand or fall by itself but
        with the whole.</p>
        <p align="justify">For instance, in this Epistle 4:3 the words
        &quot;when we were children&quot; will be interpreted to mean &quot;when
        we were at the foolish age of adolescence,&quot; and in the same way we
        shall explain the words &quot;when I was a child&quot; in First
        Corinthians 13:11. Not only will the explanation of the former stand or
        fall with the explanation of the latter; the explanation of both will
        stand or fall with the acceptability of a complex of Pauline thought of
        which they will be demonstrated to form a part.</p>
        <p align="justify">One personal trait of Epicurus that qualified him to
        blaze the way for Paul was his eagerness to retain the loyalty of his
        followers. The charm of his personality was undeniable; his teachings
        were compared to the voices of the Sirens and on the occasion of one of
        his lectures a listener was so overcome as to throw himself at the
        master's feet and reverence him as if a god. Yet this natural capacity
        was carefully supplemented by diligent planning; the loyalty of colonies
        of disciples in the three cities where he had taught before settling in
        Athens was fostered by epistles addressed to the community, by private
        letters, and in some instances by visits.</p>
        <p align="justify">In Athens itself defection from his school was so
        rare as to become a matter of record when it did occur. So many, on the
        contrary, were the desertions to his Garden from other schools that a
        disgruntled Platonist was inspired to author the sour epigram: &quot;A
        man can become a eunuch but a eunuch cannot become a man.&quot;</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        When We Were Children</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Just as Epicurus was eager to retain the loyalty of
        his disciples, so Paul in this Epistle shows himself vitally concerned
        to maintain the integrity of the Galatian church. He reveals indignation
        and no small consternation that his own authority has been attacked,
        that the party of the circumcision has been unsettling the faith of his
        converts and that some have become backsliders.</p>
        <p align="justify">This high concern for the integrity of the church
        evokes an extended chain of argument, of the casuistic sort that Paul
        must have learned at the feet of Gamaliel. This will have no bearing on
        the present inquiry until it reaches the point where a neat and
        threefold analogy has been built up: first, the age before faith, when
        man was still under the law; second, the minority of the individual
        under civil law, before he becomes master of his inheritance; and third,
        the mental minority of the individual, before he arrives at adult
        competence in judgment.</p>
        <p align="justify">The first two of the three items call for no comment;
        the third requires immediate amplification. The crucial words occur in
        4:3: &quot;So with us; when we were children, we were slaves to the
        elemental spirits of the universe.&quot; To clear away first a matter of
        minor importance, the word <i>slaves</i> need not be pressed. In Greek
        philosophy to possess the truth was styled freedom, not to possess it
        was slavery; thus <i>slave</i> meant virtually &quot;heretic&quot;; it
        was a term of depreciation and reproach.</p>
        <p align="justify">The word <i>children</i> is more important. The Greek
        word so translated is equivalent to our English &quot;infant,&quot;
        which in law may be applied to any person short of legal age. It has,
        however, a number of connotations, and it is one of these and not its
        legal denotation that applies here. It refers to persons still in their
        mental minority, adolescent lads whose language and thinking are not as
        yet characterized by responsibility. This same aspect of the age of
        adolescence is in Paul's mind when he writes in First Corinthians 13:11:
        &quot;When I was a child, I spoke as a child,&quot; and the rest.</p>
        <p align="justify">Most important of all are the words &quot;elemental
        spirits of the universe.&quot; In the Greek text there is nothing to
        call for the word spirits. The justification for this has been dug out
        of an apocryphal source and makes excessive demands upon our credulity.
        It presumes that Paul is assuming that a curious item of superstition
        which was not a matter of common belief even among the Jews was a matter
        of common knowledge among the Galatians, who were in large part of
        Gallic origin.</p>
        <p align="justify">It will consequently be much more reasonable to
        follow the King James Version and translate it &quot;elements of the
        world,&quot; which may readily be interpreted to mean the atoms of
        Epicurus, as understood in his well-known principle: &quot;The universe
        consists of atoms and space.&quot; The sole change in translation will
        be slight, to read &quot;elements of the universe&quot; in place of
        &quot;elements of the world.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If to accept this view shall merely seem to be
        imposing a different strain upon our credulity, this difficulty can be
        gradually diminished and at length resolved by a judicious survey of the
        facts. An inveterate but unfortunate tradition of learning has deflected
        all interest away from Epicurus and all but abolished him from our
        accountings of ancient thought, the thought of the New Testament
        included. We have been habituated to acquiesce in an excessive emphasis
        upon Platonism and Stoicism, creeds of the few, and an excessive
        disregard for Epicureanism, the creed of ancient multitudes, even
        barbarians. If only we can habituate ourselves to correct the balance,
        we shall achieve a momentous increase of understanding.</p>
        <p align="justify">Naturally, this correction cannot be made quickly. A
        view that is unfamiliar and unwelcome will be changed only by degrees.
        We must submit to allowing the evidences to accumulate and suspend a
        final verdict until we can view them in the aggregate.</p>

        </font><font face="Arial" size="3">The Weak and Beggarly Elements</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">In this instance we have a bevy of evidences in brief
        space. It is quite in Paul's manner, having broached an idea, to return
        to it after an interval for amplification. Thus we first meet with
        &quot;the elements of the universe&quot; in 4:3 and find second mention
        of them in 4:8 in different words: &quot;In those days, when you did not
        know God, you were in bondage to things that by nature are not
        gods.&quot; The Revised Standard reads &quot;to beings,&quot; in order
        to be consistent with the reference to the mysterious &quot;elemental
        spirits of the universe,&quot; which we met in verse 3 above.</p>
        <p align="justify">There is nothing in the Greek original, however, to
        call for &quot;beings&quot; any more than &quot;spirits.&quot; To adopt
        these words results in mere mystification. If we assume that &quot;the
        elements of the universe&quot; are the atoms and that it is these that
        &quot;by nature are not gods,&quot; we have clarity. The Epicureans
        ridiculed the idea of the resurrection and the whole Pauline theology.
        Paul is replying to ridicule with ridicule. He is hinting at the fact,
        universally known in his day, that the whole Epicurean structure of
        thought was based upon the atom, which in his grimly satirical
        interpretation is made to mean that all who accepted this account of
        things were in bondage to mere specks of matter.</p>
        <p align="justify">This satire is promptly rendered manifest in verse 9:
        &quot;how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elements,
        whose slaves you wish to be once more?&quot; Why &quot;weak and
        beggarly&quot;? The answer is not difficult. The belief was inherent in
        Judaism from the first that God was to the individual a source of
        strength. In Paul's theology this strength is channeled to the believer
        through the resurrected Christ by means of the Spirit of God; in Paul's
        own words, First Corinthians 15:45, &quot;the last Adam became a
        life-giving spirit,&quot; that is, a source of energy for the believer.
        It is in opposition to this notion that the atoms are despised as
        &quot;weak and beggarly.&quot; It is possible that these synonyms were
        deliberately chosen; the atoms are &quot;weak&quot; in satirical
        contrast with the power of God; they are &quot;beggarly&quot; in
        satirical contrast to the richness of God's grace.</p>
        <p align="justify">Incidentally, it is doubtful whether the clash
        between science and religion were ever more neatly presented than here.
        Epicurus, representing science, finds the eternal in the atom, by the
        incessant motion of which all things are created aimlessly, though
        within the limitations of natural laws. As for history, it is the
        evolution of the unintended. Paul, representing religion, finds the
        eternal in God and by his power and intelligence all things were created
        and continued to be providentially governed.</p>

        </font><font face="Arial" size="3">Days, and Months, and Seasons, and
        Years</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The next item in this paragraph of reproach to the
        backsliding Galatians runs as follows, 4:10: &quot;You observe days, and
        months, and seasons, and years.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">A more illuminating reference to Epicureanism could
        not be desired. It exhibits two aspects of interest and importance:
        first, it is amply explained by a section from the extant will and
        testament of Epicurus; and second, it anticipates the shape of things to
        come.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus was hardly less concerned to maintain the
        integrity and perpetuity of the sect he had founded than was Paul to do
        the same for the Christian church. To this end he ordained in his will
        that funds be set apart for funeral offerings for his parents and
        brothers, for commemorative services at regular intervals for the same
        and for himself and two close associates, Metrodorus and Polyaenus, who
        had predeceased him.</p>
        <p align="justify">Most important, however, was the provision for
        monthly meetings of the sect, at which a meal was served and certain
        rites performed in memory of Epicurus himself and his beloved disciple
        Metrodorus. This commemorative meeting took place on the twentieth of
        the lunar month, which to Greeks in general was a holy day, a sort of
        sabbath, and because of its sacred character Epicurus chose it for this
        celebration in place of his own birthday. It must be remembered that he
        did not consider the gods to be indifferent to human piety, even though
        they were indifferent to human wickedness, and he desired to maintain
        for his disciples a link of reverence with the divine. In other words,
        these commemorative monthly meetings, to which Paul refers scornfully in
        the words, &quot;You observe days, and months,&quot; were planned to
        possess a religious character.</p>
        <p align="justify">This item of information need not be thought
        recondite. So notorious were these meetings on the twentieth that
        disciples of Epicurus were derisively called &quot;Twentyers,&quot; and
        references to the fact are extant in Greek and Latin literature over the
        space of five centuries.</p>
        <p align="justify">As for the shape of things to come, the testamentary
        injunction of Epicurus to perpetuate the rites &quot;in remembrance of
        myself and Metrodorus&quot; can hardly fail to remind us of the saying
        recorded with certainty only by Paul in First Corinthians 11:24:
        &quot;Do this in remembrance of me.&quot; It is also well to recall in
        this connection that the savior sentiment in Paul's time was enjoying an
        almost universal vogue and the title of savior had been claimed for
        Epicurus, that his disciples spoke of following &quot;in his
        footsteps&quot; and of living &quot;as if Epicurus were looking
        on,&quot; and that they took a pledge: &quot;We will be obedient to
        Epicurus, according to whom we have made it our choice to live.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">There is something more to be said. Epicurus himself
        had instituted the custom of writing affectionate memoirs of faithful
        disciples who had predeceased him. This custom was continued by his
        successors and such writings may well be thought to prefigure the Acts
        of the Apostles and the Lives of the Saints at a later date. Moreover,
        the injunction of Epicurus to commemorate the day of his colleague
        Polyaenus may well suggest the celebration of Saints' days in the
        Christian church. In point of fact, if we may venture to generalize,
        Paul's reproachful sentence, &quot;You observe days, and months, and
        seasons, and years,&quot; may well be taken as a preview of the
        Christian calendar of today.</p>
        <p align="justify">If, then, our inference is sympathetically
        entertained, that Paul is describing Epicurean practices, the second and
        larger inference will be justified, that Epicureanism anticipated the
        practices of Christianity and functioned as a bridge of transition from
        Greek philosophy to the Christian religion.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="4" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="3">Freedom</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">In this Epistle to the Galatians Paul finds it
        fitting to his argument to dwell somewhat on the subject of freedom, and
        it will be rewarding to scrutinize his treatment of it. The approach may
        best be made by way of a brief detour.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul often employs the pronoun in the plural, using
        &quot;we&quot; to denote himself, and when he writes in 4:3, &quot;So
        with us; when we were children, we were slaves to the elements of the
        universe,&quot; we are taking him to mean: &quot;So also with myself;
        when I was at the irresponsible age of adolescence, I was addicted to
        belief in the atoms.&quot; In other words, he pleads for the sympathy of
        the Galatians because, before his own conversion, he had shared their
        error in yielding his allegiance to the creed of Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">The fickle Galatians, however, had become backsliders
        and Paul is consequently moved to lament in 4:11: &quot;I fear that I
        may have labored over you in vain.&quot; In the next verse he turns to
        exhortation, which in the Revised Standard is made to read:
        &quot;Brethren, I beseech you, become as I am, for I also have become as
        you are.&quot; These words are simple but the meaning very obscure. The
        obscurity may perhaps be resolved by a keen glance at the facts as
        implied. Both Paul and the Galatians had once yielded allegiance to
        Epicurus; both had transferred their allegiance to Christ, but the
        Galatians had become backsliders and Paul had not. Therefore Paul
        writes: &quot;Brethren, I beseech you, be like me, because I too, like
        yourselves, was once in error.&quot; He is exhorting them to emulate his
        steadfastness, just as they had once shared his error.</p>
        <p align="justify">Here we choose a small clue, which may be worth
        following up. In 4:15 the Revised Standard reads: &quot;What has become
        of the satisfaction you felt?&quot; This is possibly a mere
        modernization of the King James translation: &quot;Where is then the
        blessedness ye spake of?&quot; Both teams of translators were working in
        the dark. The Greek word which is here rendered as
        &quot;satisfaction&quot; or &quot;blessedness&quot; is <i>makarismos,</i>
        and this was taken from the vocabulary of Epicurus. In this vocabulary
        of Epicurus it is easy to discern precisely what a word means, which is
        less true of the terminology of Paul because he so often presumes a fund
        of common knowledge in his readers which we no longer possess.</p>
        <p align="justify">To Epicurus this word signified the joy, the pleasure
        without alloy, that ensues upon arrival at the truth. One of his sayings
        may be opportunely quoted: &quot;Love goes dancing around the whole
        earth, veritably shouting to us all to awake to the blessedness of the
        happy life.&quot; It was a conceit of Epicurus that the individual who
        was ignorant of the truth was living in a sort of coma. It may
        consequently be more than sheer coincidence that Paul writes in First
        Corinthians 15:34, &quot;Awake to righteousness,&quot; and in Ephesians
        5:14, &quot;Awake, thou that sleepest.&quot; The stock of ideas that is
        common to both may well arouse our curiosity and challenge our
        attention.</p>
        <p align="justify">To return to our verse, 4:15: if the Greek word
        employed by Epicurus to denote the joy of arriving at the truth has been
        taken over by Paul to denote the joy of discovering the truth as
        revealed in Jesus the Christ, we may translate: &quot;What, then, has
        become of the joy you once experienced?&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If this interpretation marks a gain in precision, it
        is still not the end. We can do better. Paul is very tenacious of his
        topic and in this instance his mind is still intent upon the joy of
        discovering the truth as revealed in Christ when he writes in 5:1:
        &quot;For freedom Christ has set us free.&quot; To this he returns again
        in verse 13: &quot;For you were called to freedom, brethren.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This is not a change of topic. It is an amplification
        of the nature of the joy that ensues upon arrival at the truth. This joy
        is a new sense of freedom. It is remarkable in the New Testament how
        frequently the words <i>free</i> and <i>freedom </i>are mentioned
        without definition. Paul makes no attempt to define <i>freedom</i> in
        the passage before us. He feels no need to define it because in the
        Greek philosophy of the time it had already been exalted to the status
        of a blessed word. Greek philosophy was offering the boon of freedom to
        the individual, nor could Christianity, if it was to compete
        successfully with philosophy, omit to offer the same boon.</p>
        <p align="justify">The word <i>freedom</i> first arrived at the status
        of blessedness in the political sphere as a sequel to the Persian
        invasion of Greece. When Persia was conquered at last by Alexander and
        Greece was stranded in a backwash by the march of change, the
        philosophers began to ponder the meaning of freedom for the inner life.
        After some fumbling by others it reached definition in the keen and
        practical mind of Epicurus. To him it became freedom from fear, freedom
        from all the things that the Greeks had feared: fate, fortune, physical
        causation, gods, death, and punishment in the afterlife. For this
        freedom from disturbing fears Epicurus used the word <i>ataraxy</i> or
        synonyms -- for he was partial to synonyms -- such as &quot;calm&quot;
        or &quot;tranquillity of mind,&quot; a metaphor taken from the sea.</p>
        <p align="justify">This transfer of the concept of freedom from the
        political to the inner life of man was paralleled among the Jews by a
        progressive increase of ethical inwardness in the religious life.
        Jehovah became less and less the God of Israel and more and more the God
        of the individual.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was the destiny of these two parallel drifts to
        coalesce at last in the teachings of Jesus and still more in those of
        Paul. The word <i>ataraxy</i> was rejected but its significance,
        &quot;calm&quot; or &quot;tranquillity of mind,&quot; was taken over by
        the word <i>peace.</i> The peace of Epicurus becomes the peace of God,
        built into a new structure of doctrine. The name of freedom, which
        stemmed from the Greek side, survived as a synonym for peace; as such it
        signifies freedom from all disturbing thoughts and emotions.</p>
        <p align="justify">This is one particular in which the teachings of
        Epicurus functioned as a bridge of transition from philosophy to
        religion; part of the common ground between them was the increasing
        interest in the individual man and the inner life.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        The Works of the Flesh</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Although the Epistle to the Galatians differs from
        others by its abrupt beginning, it conforms to the pattern by ending up
        with an admirable passage of exhortation and admonition. Exhortations to
        the study of philosophy were so much in vogue among the Greeks as to
        constitute a separate branch of writing, known as protreptic; most of
        the philosophers from Aristotle onward published writings under this
        title. Philosophy was extolled as &quot;the guide of life,&quot; an
        aspiration that survives to this day in the Phi Beta Kappa Fraternity,
        the Greek letters of this name being the initials of the words with the
        meaning quoted above.</p>
        <p align="justify">Exhortation, it must be admitted, presumes a certain
        amount of admonition but it was exclusively the merit of Epicurus to
        have elaborated this practical adjunct to exhortation. The term <i>protreptic</i>
        became technical in meaning quite apart from his teachings but the words
        <i>admonish</i> and <i>admonition</i> acquired particular meanings only
        within his writings and the studies by disciples of his who amplified
        his views. He differed from his predecessors in being a natural
        pragmatist, impatient of knowledge that possessed no bearing upon
        conduct. He was not content, for example, to draw up lists of virtues
        and vices and classify them as Aristotle did, after the same fashion
        that he classified plants and animals.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus thought of the individual as a free agent,
        completely at liberty to choose good or evil. Freedom, from this point
        of view, was liberty of choice. This point of departure was not peculiar
        to him, because it was inherent in ethical thought before him. The
        elaboration of it, on the contrary, was absolutely his own. One of his
        writings that became a classic was entitled <i>On Choices and Avoidances</i>.
        This may sound stilted to us, because it exhibits a pattern of thought
        that is no longer in vogue, but in Paul's time it was universally
        familiar among intelligent people. Traces of it in the New Testament are
        frequent; it is explicit in Third John 11: &quot;Beloved, do not imitate
        evil but imitate good.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The teachings of Epicurus, however, were being
        constantly amplified and modified for the changing demand and in Paul's
        time there was in circulation a standard work by Philodemus of Gadara
        entitled <i>On Vices and the Corresponding Virtues</i>, of which one
        book is still extant in fragments. Paul was certainly familiar with it,
        and in this Epistle as elsewhere, he adopts and adapts its contents to
        his own needs. In adapting it he even follows his model in citing the
        vices before the virtues: the former become &quot;the works of the
        flesh&quot; and the latter &quot;the works of the Spirit.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">That he is adapting, not copying, is plain also from
        his lists. For example, the vices, as they appear in the euphemistic
        revision of the Revised Standard, are as follows: immorality, impurity,
        licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger,
        selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy, drunkenness, carousing; the
        virtues are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
        faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. If these lists be scrutinized,
        it will be found impossible to match each vice by a virtue; the lists
        are unequal in number. The opposition is between vices as a class and
        virtues as a class.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;<br>
        </font><font size="3" face="Arial">False Opinions</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Incidentally, the translation of' the words in these
        lists would bear careful study in the light of our knowledge of
        Epicureanism but this would be tedious. A more immediate reward may be
        gleaned by scrutinizing Galatians 5:25, which in the Revised Standard
        reads in part: &quot;Let us have no self-conceit, no provoking of one
        another, no envy of one another.&quot; The word here rendered
        &quot;self-conceit&quot; may be shown to have signified to Epicurus the
        entertainment of what he called &quot;false opinions&quot;; for example,
        the belief that wealth, fame, or power could result in happiness. On
        this topic he had much to say, but a single dictum may serve for
        illustration: &quot;Neither is the turmoil of the soul dispelled nor any
        worthwhile happiness begotten either by possession of the greatest
        wealth or by honor and glamor in public life or by any other of the
        boundless ambitions of men.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In the present instance the &quot;false opinion&quot;
        consists in thinking that getting ahead of one's neighbors means an
        increase of happiness. In modern parlance this is a matter of false
        values. Hence we may translate: &quot;Let us not be misled by false
        ambitions, provoking one another to competition, envying one
        another.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">What Epicurus thought of envy is on record: &quot;We
        should envy no man, for good men do not deserve envy and, as for evil
        men, the more they prosper the more they spoil their own chance of
        happiness.&quot; On the evil of competition his teaching may be found in
        an Authorized Doctrine: &quot;The man who discerns the narrow limits of
        life's needs will understand how easy it is to procure what removes the
        discomfort arising from want, so that he feels no necessity of engaging
        in activities that involve competition.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The Epicurean term which translators have been
        wrongly rendering as &quot;vainglory&quot; or &quot;conceit&quot; or
        &quot;self-conceit&quot; is employed twice by Paul and by no others in
        the New Testament. The other example occurs in Philippian 2:3-4, where
        the Revised Standard goes far astray: &quot;Do nothing from selfishness
        or conceit, but in humility count others better than yourselves. Let
        each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the
        interests of others.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Here the principle of &quot;the vice and the
        corresponding virtue&quot; is invoked again, because this was for Paul a
        standard pattern of thought. The virtue is brotherly love, which
        cooperates; the vice is the spirit of competition, sparked by envy, the
        false idea that getting ahead of the other will add to one's happiness.
        Hence we may venture to translate: &quot;Doing nothing in a spirit of
        competition or false ambition but in humility counting others more
        important than yourselves, every one of you having an eye not to his own
        advantage, but rather to the good of others.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If the findings of this chapter have seemed plausible
        in detail and convincing in the aggregate, then we may safely infer that
        Paul was assuming a knowledge of Epicurean doctrines in the minds of his
        readers; and so by diligent reference to the extant writings of Epicurus
        we may often arrive at a precision never before attained in deciphering
        the meanings that Paul often felt justified in expressing somewhat
        elliptically.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4">T</font><font size="2">HE</font> brief
        Epistle to the Colossians exhibits a singular neatness. It begins with a
        sympathetic introduction, passes over to warning and remonstrance, and
        concludes with friendly admonition and exhortation. This conforms to the
        rhetorical rule that the first and last parts of a composition should be
        agreeable to the hearer or reader.</p>
        <p align="justify">The letter abounds also in evidences of Paul's
        concern with Epicureanism: some ten items of Epicurus' teachings are
        identifiable. Some of these were repellent and could only be rejected.
        One was in part acceptable but in the main offensive. Others were so
        attractive as to justify adoption. Needless to say, in no instance could
        the rival creed be conceded the honor of mention by name. In one verse,
        however, it is accorded the compliment of being referred to as
        philosophy (2:8), the sole occurrence of the word in the New Testament.</p>
        <p align="justify">Foremost among the doctrines mentioned is the atomic
        theory of the composition of matter. This was not odious in itself; it
        is quite possible that Paul accepted it, just as it was accepted in
        Second Peter 3:10 and 12 by the author of that Epistle. In order to
        accept it the only necessity was to assume that God had created the
        atoms and could destroy them. The odious thing about the atomic theory
        was the use to which Epicurus had put it, claiming to deduce from it his
        system of knowledge, ethics and theology included. Paul's revolt against
        this claim is registered for us in his assertion that &quot;all the
        treasures of wisdom and knowledge&quot; are hidden in Jesus Christ or in
        God. Philosophy stimulated the growth of religion by the force of
        repulsion.</p>
        <p align="justify">A particular feature of atomism that rendered it
        odious to Paul was its association with the denial of divine providence.
        Hence he damns it (2:8) as &quot;according to the tradition of men&quot;
        and &quot;not according to Christ.&quot; It deserves to be pointed out,
        however, that even this association is not inherent in the theory
        itself. It did not discourage Pierre Gassendi, for example, the Roman
        Catholic priest who sponsored the revival of Epicureanism in the
        seventeenth century, from accepting the theory.</p>
        <p align="justify">The offense was not in the atoms but in the
        assumption of Epicurus that their motions were the primal cause of all
        things in a universe self-regulated by natural laws. There were gods, he
        taught, but no participation was assigned to them either in the
        government of the universe or the affairs of mankind. This teaching
        precluded the idea of either a general or a special providence. It
        precluded equally all notion of revealed religion; hence it was
        &quot;the tradition of men.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Of minor rank to the items above mentioned, though
        not unimportant, is the warning against Epicurean ridicule of the
        worship of angels (2:18). A correct interpretation of the verse in
        question will call for a change in the Revised Standard Version, as will
        be shown in due time.</p>
        <p align="justify">Midway between offensive and acceptable doctrines was
        one in part commendable, in part reprehensible. Epicurus recommended the
        simple life, including plainness of diet, but unluckily he also gave his
        approval to the occasional indulgence on the ground that the pleasure
        was increased by previous abstinence; he called this &quot;condensing
        pleasure.&quot; It was Paul's verdict that the latter teaching canceled
        the merit of the other (2:23). A right understanding of this will again
        require a revision of the translation.</p>
        <p align="justify">Among doctrines of major importance that were
        unconditionally repudiated was the canon of truth according to Epicurus,
        who set up the Sensations, and especially the sense of sight, as the
        chief criteria of truth. Paul's retort to this was to exalt spiritual
        insight, the gift of God, as the sole criterion of truth on the highest
        level of human experience. His scorn of his unnamed competitor is
        expressed in the words (2:18): &quot;ta King his stand on what he has
        seen, puffed up without justification by the mind of the flesh.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul's main exposition of spiritual insight as the
        canon or criterion of truth may be found in First Corinthians 2, and
        more detailed comment will be made upon it in that connection.</p>
        <p align="justify">Entirely acceptable to Paul was the Epicurean
        sponsorship of personal purity and all the homely virtues that conduce
        to peace and harmony in family and community life. No less than two
        fifths of his space is devoted to these topics in this letter. As for
        the familiar Epicurean practice of opposing &quot;the vices to the
        corresponding virtues,&quot; we have seen that this was not merely
        acceptable to Paul; he makes a fetish of it, elaborating upon it not
        only here but also in the Epistles to the Ephesians, Galatians, and
        Corinthians. Its presence accounts for the attractiveness of several of
        our most prized devotional readings.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Colossae</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">This outline of topics will presently be amplified
        but precedence must be given to certain significant items concerning
        Colossae. It was the sort of community where Epicureanism flourished.
        When the biographer of Epicurus wrote &quot;of his friends so many in
        multitude as not to be counted even by whole cities,&quot; he was
        thinKing of such towns of moderate size. To have so spoken of
        metropolitan cities like Antioch and Alexandria would have been
        unjustified; in such centers the friendly philosophy undoubtedly did
        flourish but the conditions most favorable to its vogue were to be found
        in the smaller cities and towns. It discouraged all competitive careers.</p>
        <p align="justify">Colossae, like Laodicea, where this Epistle was also
        to be circulated, lay a few miles inland from Ephesus. In the same
        district was Colophon, where Epicurus had been domiciled with his
        parents and three brothers during the decisive decade between his
        twentieth and thirtieth years, and it was there that he had worked out
        his system of philosophy to its completion.</p>
        <p align="justify">This recital, however, does not exhaust the items of
        significance. Many years later, after he was firmly established as the
        head of a flourishing school in Athens, he made two or three journeys to
        these parts, a morsel of information that carries the more weight
        because he traveled nowhere else. While these journeys may suggest the
        missionary pilgrimages of Paul, the parallel is heightened when it is
        recalled that one of the published epistles of Epicurus was addressed To
        the Friends in Asia, which cannot but remind us of Paul's Epistle to the
        Ephesians.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus it is not unjustifiable to think of Colossae as
        situated in the homeland of Epicureanism. This inference receives
        confirmation from a singular fact: some seventy years ago the doctrines
        of Epicurus were discovered to have been carved on the wall of a
        colonnade in the market place of an obscure town named Oenoanda,
        situated some fifty miles to the south of Colossae. This inscription is
        estimated to have run to the length of three hundred feet, and though
        done at private expense, could have been executed only with the approval
        of the local authorities. Thus in one and the same monument we have
        incontestable evidence of the vogue of Epicureanism in these parts and
        of the truth of the statement that the friends of Epicurus could be
        counted by whole cities.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Beguiling Speech</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The Epicureans were suave and persistent missionaries
        for their creed. One of the injunctions of the founder was &quot;to let
        pass no opportunity to disseminate the sayings of the true
        philosophy.&quot; It was they against whom Paul warned the Philippians
        (3:2) as &quot;evil workers,&quot; though a diligent student may well
        suspect that these words mean &quot;mischievous busybodies.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">As for their suavity, for this we have the word of
        St. Augustine, who, as he informs us himself, &quot;would have awarded
        the palm to Epicurus but for his denial of divine providence and the
        judgment of merits.&quot; It was his choice to characterize the sect by
        three watchwords, Pleasure, Suavity, and Peace. It was this suavity or
        persuasiveness that was causing concern to Paul in far-off Rome when he
        composed this letter. So his heartening introductory messages are
        promptly followed by the warning words, 2:4; &quot;I say this in order
        that no one may delude you with beguiling speech.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">While this rendering may deserve a slight preference
        over the &quot;enticing words&quot; of the King James Version, it is
        hardly precise enough. If the translator scans the Greek sentence with
        diligence, it must become clear that Paul's fear is of the Christians'
        being reasoned out of their belief by some kind of logic. It will then
        be better to write: &quot;I am saying this that no one may lead you
        astray with plausible reasoning.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In this instance it will be worth while to know that
        Paul is employing a procedure that was favored by Epicurus himself, who
        would lead off with a general statement and then proceed to amplify it
        by degrees. After this fashion the general warning of Paul against
        &quot;plausible reasoning&quot; in verse 4 is here amplified with
        suitable detail in verse 8: &quot;See to it that no one makes a prey of
        you by philosophy and vain deception, according to the tradition of men,
        according to the elements of the universe and not according to
        Christ.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It will be enlightening to exemplify this
        &quot;plausible reasoning&quot; at once. According to Epicurus the
        source of all truth is to be found in the study of nature. To this
        scientific knowledge Paul has already opposed in verse 3 &quot;the
        recognition of the mystery of God, of Christ, in whom are hid all the
        treasures of wisdom and knowledge.&quot; Thus the teachings of Epicurus
        are &quot;according to the tradition of men and not according to
        Christ.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Again, Epicurus taught that every natural desire has
        a natural ceiling; for example, the natural ceiling of the pleasure of
        eating and drinking is the satisfaction of hunger and thirst. Therefore
        fullness of pleasure is possible. Fullness of pleasure, in turn, means
        fullness of life. To this Paul sets in opposition, verse 9: &quot;For in
        him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily and it is in him that you
        have come to fullness of life.&quot; Fullness of life, it is implied,
        means attainment to likeness to the divine nature.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet Paul, while amplifying his theme after the
        fashion of Epicurus, introduces his own variation and contrives to
        alternate warning against false doctrine with positive instruction. So
        in this instance he is prompted by the repudiation of atomism as a
        source of truth to set forth the mysteries of the new life in Christ and
        to expound the victory of the cross, verses 11-15.</p>
        <p align="justify">After this timely exposition he returns with his
        usual tenacity of thought to details of warning. The Colossians would
        have been observing the Sabbath and other holy days with the usual
        regulations concerning food and fasting. If these observances had been
        part of the law of the land, the Epicureans would have been tolerant of
        them; but they were not requirements of law; they were merely rules of a
        sect and as such were a fit subject for ridicule. They would have been
        mocked as servile self-subjection to the fear of divine wrath, of which
        the Epicureans declared the divine being to be incapable. Observance was
        consequently foolishness.</p>
        <p align="justify">It will be best to take up first the question of
        angels, because a little knowledge of Epicurean teaching will enable us
        for the first time to set to rights a perplexing verse in respect of
        which the Revised Standard has gone astray: &quot;Let no man disqualify
        you, insisting upon self-abasement and the worship of angels.&quot; This
        is the opposite of the true meaning.</p>
        <p align="justify">To the Epicureans the belief in angels would have
        been equivalent to the belief in demons, an inferior class of divine
        beings. The mere suggestion that such beings existed is said to have
        irritated them. All divine beings, according to Epicurus, lived remote
        from this earth of ours, indifferent to human wickedness and incapable
        even of surviving under terrestrial conditions. Moreover, to believe
        that divine beings performed the functions ascribed to angels would be
        to demean them. Lastly, if men believed in angels they would also fear
        them, while the fullness of pleasure, that is, happiness, required
        complete emancipation from the fear of gods.</p>
        <p align="justify">A precise translation must then be worded to read:
        &quot;Let no man willfully humiliate you, taunting you with
        self-abasement and the worship of angels.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The Revised Standard reads, &quot;Let no man
        disqualify you.&quot; This is an error. The Greek verb does not mean to
        disqualify a candidate before a contest begins but to eliminate him
        while the contest is in progress and hence to humiliate. The Epicurean
        Philodemus in his treatise on Pride cites the example of a pompous
        singer who was stopped by the umpire in the middle of his song and
        ordered from the stage; this was the extremity of humiliation. To
        eliminate a contestant was to humiliate him. So we arrive at the
        version, &quot;Let no man humiliate you.&quot;</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        The Canon of Truth</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Undeniable proof that the reference in the above
        verse is to Epicurean ridicule is afforded by the concluding phrases:
        &quot;taking his stand on visions, puffed up without justification by
        the mind of the flesh.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul is retorting to ridicule with ridicule. Epicurus
        had rejected the divine reason extolled by Plato as the criterion of
        truth and in its place substituted Nature. He denied the existence of
        reason apart from the body. The ability to reason, he insisted, was a
        faculty of the mind, just as the ability to see and hear are faculties
        of the eyes and ears. The mind, he taught, was an organ of the body no
        less than the eyes and the ears. It is this teaching that Paul is
        scorning when he speaks of &quot;the mind of the flesh.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In reality Paul is repeating the performance of
        Epicurus. He is reasoning after a similar fashion. Just as Epicurus had
        rejected the divine reason of Plato, so Paul is rejecting &quot;the mind
        of the flesh.&quot; He substitutes for it the divine spirit, which is
        not innate in man but becomes resident in man through acceptation of the
        resurrected Christ. This is a miracle of the religious experience. When
        once it has taken place, and only then, the individual becomes capable
        of discerning spiritual truths, because, as Paul writes in First
        Corinthians 2:14, spiritual truths are spiritually discerned. This topic
        of the canon of truth will be suitably amplified in the study of the
        chapter cited above.</p>
        <p align="justify">Incidentally, when Paul writes &quot;puffed up,&quot;
        this may be explained from the stage practice of employing inflated
        skins to build out the figure of an actor for a pompous role. The charge
        of overweening self-confidence was perpetually urged against Epicurus,
        who denied debt to any teacher, styled himself &quot;self-taught,&quot;
        arrogated to himself the sole right to the title of wise man, and
        claimed to be the sole discoverer of truth.</p>
        <p align="justify">The disciples of Epicurus continued to bear a similar
        reputation among adherents of rival schools, who set no limit to their
        abusiveness. That among the members of a numerous sect there were some
        who amply deserved such censures can hardly be doubted, but the ultimate
        basis of the charge of arrogance may be found in dogmatism. The Academy
        of Plato and the Lyceum of Aristotle had professed to be schools of
        inquiry. Epicurus, who succeeded them after a brief interval, came out
        flatly for dogmatism, as one of his sayings attests: &quot;The wise man
        will dogmatize and will not be a doubter.&quot; He published his
        Authorized Doctrines and his Elementary Principles of Physics and
        encouraged memorization; his writings were textbooks.</p>
        <p align="justify">That this dogmatism was in Paul's mind is plainly
        hinted by a word that he uses but once and no other writer uses it in
        the New Testament. It is found in 2:20, where the Revised Standard
        reads: &quot;Why do you submit to regulations?&quot; The King James has
        &quot;ordinances.&quot; Literally, however, we should read: &quot;Why do
        you submit to dogmatism?&quot; The inference that these words serve to
        identify the dogmatic Epicurean is confirmed by the previous part of the
        sentence, which we venture to retranslate as a whole: &quot;If with
        Christ you died and took leave of the elements of the world, why, as if
        living in the world, do you submit to dogmatism?&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It may even seem that at least some of the Colossian
        Christians, like the Galatians, had been subscribing to the creed of
        Epicurus before their conversion. At any rate, we have here in the space
        of three verses, 18-20, no fewer than five identifying tags of
        Epicureanism: &quot;taking his stand on visions&quot; or, literally,
        &quot;what he has seen,&quot; which hints at the Sensations as criteria
        of truth; &quot;puffed up,&quot; which refers to the tradition of
        arrogance in the sect; &quot;the sensuous mind,&quot; or literally and
        better, &quot;the mind of the flesh,&quot; which should remind us of the
        teaching that the mind is an organ of the body just as the ears or the
        eyes; &quot;the elements of the world&quot; or &quot;of the
        universe,&quot; which means the atoms and the creed of which they were
        the symbol; and lastly, &quot;Why do you submit to dogmatism?&quot; As
        we have seen, Epicurus was the first dogmatic philosopher.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;<br>
        <font size="3" face="Arial">On Condensing Pleasure</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Having now established beyond much doubt an Epicurean
        context of thought we are at last in a better position to interpret and
        translate the last verse of this second chapter. Since the King James
        rendering fails to make sense we quote only the Revised Standard; the
        reference is to &quot;human precepts and doctrines&quot;: &quot;These
        have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting rigor of devotion and
        self-abasement and severity to the body, but they are of no value in
        checking the indulgence of the flesh.&quot; This version makes sense but
        its correctness is debatable. A little-known doctrine of Epicurus may
        profitably be invoked. It involves the teaching we have mentioned
        earlier in this chapter, of which it was said that Paul in part approved
        and in part disapproved.</p>
        <p align="justify">The topic is manifestly food and the use of it on
        feast days and other special occasions. Epicurus advocated the simple
        life, including the simple diet, but he did not demand an adherence to
        the latter under all circumstances. What he did demand at all times was
        self-control and the willingness to adapt one's self to conditions as
        one found them. It was of this principle that Paul wholeheartedly
        approved, as attested in Philippians 4:11: &quot;For I have learned to
        be content with the conditions in which I find myself.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The teaching that Paul could not condone was known as
        &quot;condensing pleasure.&quot; According to Epicurus this mortal life,
        being the only life, was the most precious possession of man, and it was
        the part of reason to so plan the whole life as to enjoy it to the full.
        Fullness of pleasure was the objective; fullness was exalted to the
        status of a blessed word.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was part of the rational planning of life to
        practice a sort of economy of pleasure. The meaning of this may be made
        quite plain by modern examples. If we should indulge in a Sunday dinner
        every day, the pleasure would be diluted and thereby diminished and this
        would be a waste of pleasure. It is the moderation of the rest of the
        week that gives zest to the Sunday dinner. On such occasions the
        pleasure may be said to be &quot;condensed,&quot; though modern usage
        would prefer to say &quot;enhanced.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It was inevitable that this idea of &quot;condensing
        pleasure,&quot; even if approved in practice, should have evoked scorn.
        The very name of pleasure is frightening to strict moralists and the
        mere suggestion of &quot;condensing pleasure&quot; was to compound the
        felony, as it were. A long burlesque of the doctrine is still extant
        from an ancient comedy and quite appropriately placed in the mouth of a
        cook.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Epicureans were derisively called &quot;Twentyers,&quot;
        because they celebrated a banquet regularly on the twentieth day of the
        lunar month, as provided for in the will of Epicurus. If we may trust
        the testimony of enemies, the wines and viands on these occasions were
        of the best. Modern Christians, by the way, will have no excuse for
        murmuring, because their practice coincides nicely with the teaching of
        Epicurus. We celebrate not only the greater occasions, such as Easter,
        Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas, with richer foods, but also birthdays
        and other anniversaries of private life.</p>
        <p align="justify">Let us now be very circumspect in studying Paul's
        judgment in this matter. In the first place, he was no ascetic; he saw
        no merit in practicing abstinence at all times. In Philippians 4:12 he
        writes, if we translate the Greek literally: &quot;At any and all times
        I have learned both how to eat my fill and how to go hungry.&quot; What
        he did condemn, it appears, was to make a deliberate practice of
        preparing a sumptuous meal. This deliberate indulgence, in his opinion,
        canceled the merit of the previous abstinence.</p>
        <p align="justify">The final difficulty lies in the problem of
        retranslating verse 23, which has long been a puzzle. If we agree with
        the authors of the Revised Standard, the rules of abstinence &quot;are
        of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh.&quot; If we
        entertain instead the suggestion made above, that the rules do possess
        merit but this is canceled by the deliberate indulgence that follows, we
        may then translate: &quot;are of no esteem at all in view of the
        indulgence of the flesh.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The whole verse may then be rendered somewhat
        differently: &quot;These rules do indeed possess some claim to wisdom on
        the score of self-discipline and moderation and self-denial in respect
        of the body but are of no esteem at all in view of the indulgence of the
        flesh.&quot;</p>

        Friendly Admonition</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">It has long been a fond tradition of Christian
        scholars that Paul was partial to Stoicism, but the closing chapters of
        Colossians, like those of Galatians and Ephesians, demonstrate clearly
        his greater affinity with the peaceful and friendly Epicureans. The
        motivation may be new but the virtues are the same. The structure of
        meanings may have been rebuilt but the good Christian will still deport
        himself after the fashion of a good Epicurean.</p>
        <p align="justify">On the level of social virtues the procedure of the
        Epicureans may be conveniently denoted by the words <i>admonish</i> and <i>admonition,</i>
        which Paul takes over from them without concealment and shares with no
        other writers in the New Testament. It was in the school of his suave
        competitors that these words had been exalted to particular importance
        and received a certain specialization of meaning. They signified
        friendly suggestion and advice unmixed with blame, censure, or
        reprimand. Each Epicurean group was expected to be more or less
        independent and devoted to mutual instruction and tactful encouragement.
        This is precisely what Paul coveted for his nascent Christian
        communities, as he often makes plain, for instance, in this very Epistle
        to the Colossians 3:16: &quot;as you teach and admonish one another in
        all wisdom.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The content of his own admonition conforms to this
        pattern. All of the Greek schools of philosophy had been making studies
        of the virtues but they parted from one another in their structures of
        meanings. Aristotle, for example, arranged all vices and virtues in
        groups of three, the virtue being the mean between two extremes, which
        were vices. Thus courage is the mean between recklessness and cowardice.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus, taking his beginning from the assumption of
        free will in man, which consists in the liberty to choose either good or
        evil, instituted the expedient of opposing the vice to the corresponding
        virtue, as amply explained already in the chapter on Galatians. Paul
        takes over this expedient and handles it with admirable inventiveness.
        In Galatians he opposes &quot;the works of the flesh&quot; to &quot;the
        works of the Spirit&quot; and the latter is paraphrased as &quot;the
        fruit of the Spirit.&quot; Each of these categories is buttressed by
        formidable lists of vices and virtues.</p>
        <p align="justify">In Colossians he exhibits the usual devotion to this
        useful pattern of exhortation but the vices are now designated as
        &quot;what is earthly in you,&quot; and his list is with casual
        discernment broken in two. In verse 3:5 we should observe the vices that
        are personal to the individual: &quot;immorality, impurity, passion,
        evil desire, and covetousness.&quot; In verse 8 we should observe those
        vices that directly affect the relations of the individual with others:
        &quot;anger, wrath, malice, slander, and foul talk.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The corresponding virtues are handled with a similar
        view to variety and emphasis; the formal list is brief:
        &quot;compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, and patience,&quot;
        while forgiveness and love are separated from the rest for special
        stress. In all this Paul was urging nothing that the Epicurean might not
        have stressed, but for the conclusion he singles out the motivation,
        which was new, verse 17: &quot;do everything in the name of the Lord
        Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">A pause for reflection at this point may serve to
        give a lift to our understanding. Philosophy reacts upon religion
        through the forces of attraction and repulsion. An example of the
        attraction in the case of Paul is his partiality for the expedient of
        opposing the vice to the virtue. An example of the repulsion may be
        found in the motivation. To his disciples Epicurus was a savior. They
        were encouraged to live &quot;as if Epicurus were looking on.&quot; They
        took a pledge: &quot;We will be obedient to Epicurus, according to whom
        we have made it our choice to live.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus Epicurus, though long since in his grave, was
        still to a multitude of people a personal leader and, so far as Paul was
        concerned, a sort of Antichrist. It is for this reason that Paul remains
        so deeply concerned about the motivation of conduct. For the genuine
        Epicurean the head of the house, in a way, was Epicurus. Knowing this,
        we shall better appreciate what is in the mind of Paul in making a
        fetish of the word <i>head.</i> In this Epistle, for example, 2:10,
        Christ is &quot;the head of all rule and authority&quot; and in
        Ephesians 5:23 he is &quot;the head of the church.&quot; This principle
        in our day, of course, has the status of a Christian dogma but in Paul's
        time it was an innovation, a doctrine fresh from the mint of his mind
        and rendered indispensable by the rival eminence of a revered
        philosopher.</p>
        <p align="justify">The case is similar with the virtue of gratitude. In
        the verse 3:17 Paul joins the exhortation &quot;to do everything in the
        name of the Lord Jesus,&quot; with a supplement, &quot;giving thanks to
        God the Father through him.&quot; Epicurus had already exalted gratitude
        to the status of a blessed concept in the public mind by multifarious
        teachings. He discerned in the corresponding vice, ingratitude, an enemy
        of happiness and he urged gratitude to parents, teachers, friends, and
        even to Nature: &quot;Thanks be to blessed Nature, because she has made
        the necessities of life inexpensive and expensive things
        unnecessary.&quot; To this it should be added, as a momentous addition,
        that to Epicurus himself, as the discoverer of truth, was due the
        supreme gratitude.</p>
        <p align="justify">With such details of the background in mind we may
        the better understand why Paul is so assiduous in teaching that the
        supreme gratitude should be felt toward God the Father, the source of
        all good. In this third chapter alone he urges the giving of thanks no
        less than three times and once in the fourth.</p>
        <p align="justify">This emphasis upon gratitude to God, however, need
        not imply Paul's failure to discern the value of this virtue as
        contributory to the happy life. He could not have overlooked the fact
        that ungrateful people are not only disagreeable but also unhappy. He
        may be taken to have assumed the truth of this. What he is demanding
        above all else is the centering of the religious life in God. He may
        even have appreciated a lesser known teaching of Epicurus, that actions
        may precede thoughts and the habit of giving thanks to God may engender
        a feeling of gratitude toward God. Thus with both men the virtue of
        gratitude is essentially the same, an ingredient of the happy life; Paul
        enlarges its application and builds it into a new structure of doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">It will be equally enlightening to fix the attention
        for a moment upon the topic of peace. This was one of three words by
        which St. Augustine characterized the Epicureans. They commended all the
        homely virtues that made for peace and harmony in the household:
        forgiveness, forbearance, considerateness. These are the very qualities
        that Paul enumerates even in greater detail, not omitting the
        corresponding vices. When he urges wives &quot;to be subject to your
        husbands&quot; and husbands &quot;to, love your wives&quot;, this is for
        the sake of peace; only the motivation is changed, &quot;as is fitting
        in the Lord&quot;.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is because of this new motivation that Paul can be
        acquitted of inconsistency when he expresses scorn of Peace with Safety
        in First Thessalonians 5:3 and elsewhere urges the cult of peace with no
        less, and even more, assiduity than Epicurus. The peace of Epicurus was
        &quot;according to the tradition of men&quot;; it is replaced by
        &quot;the peace of Christ,&quot; as in this context, and elsewhere by
        &quot;the peace of God,&quot; but, by whichever name he calls it,
        &quot;the peace of Epicurus&quot; has preceded it in point of time. It
        was Epicurus who had first launched this term upon its way to become a
        blessed word.</p>

        Paul and Metamorphosis</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">We shall be further assisted toward apprehending the
        process of transition from philosophy to religion by spotting and
        correcting an error of translation. In Colossians 3:10 the Revised
        Standard reads in part: &quot;and have put on the new nature, which is
        being renewed in knowledge after the image of the creator.&quot; The
        error lies in the word <i>knowledge.</i> Knowledge is the state of
        knowing but the Greek word here employed is <i>epignosis,</i> which
        denotes the experience of passing from ignorance to knowledge or from
        the inability to understand to the ability to understand.</p>
        <p align="justify">This point may seem subtle but Paul is capable of
        subtleties. He is referring to the miracle of the religious experience.
        Simultaneously with the acceptance of the resurrected Christ the
        individual is declared to be born again to possess a new kind of
        understanding, spiritual insight, by which spiritual truths are
        discerned and judged. If this idea be kept in mind, we may translate the
        whole verse: &quot;having put off the nature of the former man along
        with his actions, and having put on the nature of the new man, which is
        being renewed after the image of its creator to possess a new kind of
        understanding.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It sometimes happens that the sauce is as good as the
        meat and in this instance our comment will be as spicy as the truth.
        When Paul speaks of &quot;putting off&quot; the one nature and
        &quot;putting on&quot; the new nature, he is thinking of the phenomenon
        of metamorphosis in creatures like the cicada, resembling the
        thirteen-year locusts of America, which is numerous in the eastern
        Mediterranean. It emerges from the ground as an ugly insect, literally
        &quot;puts off&quot; its chrysalis and &quot;puts on&quot; a new form,
        and begins a new life as a winged creature. This miracle of nature is
        suggested as an image of the religious experience.</p>
        <p align="justify">The spice of our comment consists in this, that Paul
        is here appealing to the authority of Nature, which Epicurus extolled as
        the source of all truth. Paul is virtually inviting us to believe that
        the miracle of spiritual conversion is no less natural than the miracle
        of the metamorphosis of the caterpillar into the butterfly, if we may be
        prepared to substitute a more familiar example than the cicada. He even
        reminds us of a significant detail: the individual puts off the old
        nature &quot;along with its actions&quot;; he is reminding us that the
        habits of the caterpillar are quite different from the habits of the
        butterfly. Similarly, he would have us believe, the individual is born
        anew in Christ to possess a new kind of understanding, which will result
        in a new pattern of behavior.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is worth while to add that Epicurus himself had
        appealed to the phenomenon of metamorphosis to illustrate a different
        truth. Thus Paul involves himself in the inconsistency of reasoning
        after the fashion of Epicurus to render understandable and acceptable a
        new truth that was quite incompatible with Epicurean theology.</p>
        <p align="justify">If before taking leave of this Epistle we make the
        usual pause for reflection, we shall profit by recalling once more that
        philosophy influences religion by the forces of attraction and
        repulsion.</p>
        <p align="justify">On the principle of repulsion we must learn to reason
        from opposite to opposite. For example, when Paul writes with scorn of
        &quot;the mind of the flesh&quot;, we should accustom ourselves to be
        reminded of spiritual insight, the mind of the Spirit, as it were, which
        is independent of the flesh and acquired by gift through the grace of
        God. Again, when Paul asserts that &quot;all the treasures of wisdom and
        knowledge&quot; are hidden in God, we should let ourselves be reminded
        that he is tacitly repudiating the dogma of Epicurus that the principles
        of ethics are to be deduced from the study of nature, or, in other
        words, that Nature is the source of all truth.</p>
        <p align="justify">The force of attraction operates less simply and
        directly. While the religious man feels a definite relish in being
        repelled by an alleged atheist and sponsor of expediency such as
        Epicurus, he experiences a signal embarrassment in being attracted. In
        consequence he will be careful not to admit his indebtedness and may
        even take measures to conceal it. Paul's device was to change the
        motivation. The members of his churches are to put aside &quot;anger,
        wrath, malice, slander, and foul talk,&quot; not because they destroy
        the peace of the community, but because they are &quot;earthly&quot; or
        &quot;works of the flesh&quot; or displeasing to the Lord.</p>
        <p align="justify">We may well, however, remain on our guard and not
        fall into the error of supposing the law of expediency to have been
        abrogated by the change of motive. If anger and malice and slander are
        displeasing to the Lord, it is because they demean the individual and
        ruin the peace of the community, just as Epicurus taught.</p>
        <p align="justify">The attitude of Paul toward Epicureanism may perhaps
        be better appreciated if we call attention to the behavior of the
        Stoics. By the time of Marcus Aurelius they had incorporated so much of
        Epicureanism into their teachings that the guileless emperor in his <i>Meditations</i>
        is not even aware when he is voicing the precepts of the anonymous
        philosopher. Often only the label is Stoic. Epicurus was doomed to
        anonymity, as in the New Testament. The modern Christian is no more
        aware than was Marcus Aurelius of his invisible indebtedness to the
        kindly philosophy of a man whom history has treated with gross
        injustice.

        </font></b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4">F</font><font size="2">OR</font> the purpose of this study
        it should be remembered as we approach the Epistle to the Ephesians that
        the country around Ephesus was to Epicureanism what Galilee was to
        Christianity. The name of Epicurus has always been associated with
        Athens but he was thirty-five years of age when he took up residence
        there, and the city was chosen chiefly for its prestige as a cultural
        capital, from which a world philosophy could best be disseminated. No
        bid was made for the patronage of the Athenian public and conflicts with
        the authorities were avoided by confining instruction to the famous
        Garden, which was private property. The Athenians happened to be at the
        time in a persecuting mood and in the previous year, 307 B.C., had
        enacted the death penalty for any philosopher offering instruction in
        public without a license. The law was quickly repealed but the threat
        persisted.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus was born in Asia and even the Greek he wrote
        was not the pure Attic. His birthplace was the island of Samos, where he
        received his early and secondary education and lived to the age of
        eighteen. For ten years he was afterward domiciled with his parents and
        three brothers at Colophon, except for intervals of schooling, mainly at
        the neighboring Teos. These three places are all close to Ephesus and it
        was in this region that Epicurus wrestled with the problems of the
        nature of things and of human conduct; it was there he experienced his
        illuminations and kneaded his philosophy into a coherent whole. After
        becoming famous he visited the region two or three times and composed an
        epistle addressed <i>To the Friends in Asia</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify">The situation is consequently unique so far as the
        enterprises of Epicurus and Paul are concerned. The latter had almost
        seemed to be avoiding the parishes of Epicurus. Had he entered Bithynia,
        he might have emerged on the Hellespont where his predecessor had taught
        for four years, but he was dissuaded by the Spirit of Jesus ( Acts
        16:6-7). Had he entered the Roman province of Asia, he might have
        emerged at the coast and visited Mytilene, where Epicurus had taught
        briefly and founded a colony of disciples, but he was forbidden by the
        Holy Spirit. Only at Ephesus, therefore, were the rival creeds of these
        two gifted men contending with each other on ground that was common to
        both.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is tempting to make a comparison of the two. Some
        modern Plutarch might discern in such a project an enticing opportunity
        to produce a new specimen of Parallel Lives. Both men were celibates on
        principle, and dubious of the blessings of wedlock. Both men were
        afflicted by ill health and yet both were capable of more labor than
        robust individuals. Both had a way of picking up faithful followers:
        during his brief sojourn in Mytilene Epicurus picked up Hermarchus, who
        lived with him ever afterward and became his successor as head of the
        school; in like manner Paul picked up Timothy at Lystra, who shared all
        his subsequent labors. Both men demanded and commanded loyalty of all
        converts and went to all lengths to retain it. Epicurus was bent upon
        proclaiming to all men the call to the happy life; Paul was bent upon
        awakening all men to the call of the cross, even if it meant
        persecution. Both men were agile fencers with the rapiers of logic and
        both erected coherent structures of doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">An amusing item of similarity between the two is the
        gift of persuasive speech. It is amusing because Paul warns his converts
        against the &quot;enticing words&quot; or the &quot;beguiling
        speech&quot; of the Epicureans, though possessing a like talent himself
        to a remarkable degree. The teachings of Epicurus were likened by his
        followers to the voices of the Sirens, but no more Siren-like passages
        need be sought in literature than the thirteenth or fifteenth chapters
        of First Corinthians or the concluding part of this very Epistle to the
        Ephesians. All three passages exhibit the persuasiveness of a man who
        has mastered the rules of the schools without being mastered by them,
        who moves toward the goal of his argument with the ease of practiced
        experience and carries his readers along with him to a predetermined
        climax and glad conviction.</p>

        The Prince of the Power of the Air</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">There was one talent the exercise of which was denied
        to both Epicurus and Paul. Both were ardent moralists, a noble breed of
        men but as such forbidden the use of humor. The one form of wit that
        befitted them was satire, which belittles the competitor and lingers in
        the memory. Epicurus was a master of it. He dubbed the Platonists as
        &quot;hangers-on of Dionysus,&quot; the god of the theater; he referred
        to them as &quot;the men who pitch their voices low,&quot; as if
        unemployed actors, would-be Hamlets, as it were, itching for kingly
        roles. Paul belittled the Epicureans as a Peace-at-any-Price Party or
        Safety-First Party, designating them by their catchwords Peace and
        Safety; but his masterpiece of satire is to be found in this Epistle: he
        satirizes Epicurus as &quot;prince of the power of the air.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">These words have the sound of something mystical but
        there need be no mystery about the interpretation. The meaning may be
        hidden out of sight but it is not buried out of reach. If it is not
        manifest at a glance, this is because it is built into a structure of
        thought such as both Epicurus and Paul knew well how to handle. To
        arrive at the meaning it is necessary to analyze the structure, take it
        apart and put it together again. Those who are incapable of such an
        operation or shrink from the effort will not understand Paul's writings.
        His truth is not presented in pellet form, for which the reader had
        better go to the Book of Proverbs. Though it be true that truth is more
        easily ingested in the shape of a pill, the hard fact remains that the
        more potent and lofty truths resist reduction to such a form.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is partly the fault of the translator and partly
        the fault of the reader that &quot;the prince of the power of the
        air&quot; seems mystical. The word <i>prince</i> will mislead us. The
        Greek word so translated is <i>archon,</i> which may be found even in a
        small English dictionary. It means &quot;ruler&quot; and is so rendered
        in the Gospels. It can be employed of Satan or Beelzebub and this
        association of ideas may mislead us. Epicurus denied belief in all
        demons or inferior deities and consequently it would be out of place to
        think of him as ruler of agents of mischief. With this caution in mind
        it will be well to postpone the interpretation of the word <i>prince</i>
        until the meaning of &quot;the power of the air&quot; has been
        discovered.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        The Power of the Air</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The interpretation of this phrase involves a neat
        problem in semantics. The natural impulse will be to appeal to the
        common sense of mankind. This will suggest to us that in every language
        there must be a word meaning &quot;air&quot; which can be equated to
        words in other languages meaning &quot;air.&quot; Unfortunately this is
        not true; it is a tragic fact of life that common sense can prevent a
        man from discerning the truth and has often become an obstacle to the
        advancement of science.</p>
        <p align="justify">Our modern knowledge often prevents us from
        understanding the ancients. We know too much; we know that air is mainly
        a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, which can be condensed into a liquid
        for many useful purposes and curious experiments. To the Greeks, on the
        contrary, air was the inert component of the atmosphere, and Paul's
        readers so understood it. It was motionless and cold; it could not be
        heated, though heat could be mixed with it, because heat was regarded as
        a separate element. Moreover, wind was not believed to be air in motion;
        it too was a separate element, the restless and mobile component of the
        atmosphere. It was the nature of wind to be in motion just as it was the
        nature of air not to be in motion.</p>
        <p align="justify">From this nonsensical structure of thought, which
        even to Aristotle seemed to be common sense, we pass next to an
        Epicurean structure. To Epicurus &quot;the power of the air&quot; was to
        produce calm; by nature it was motionless and hindered motion in other
        elements. Atoms of air, as ingredients of the human soul, engendered
        tranquillity of mind and serenity of countenance. An excess of air in
        the soul accounted for the placidity of the ox or, as we should say, the
        contented cow. Similarly, an excess of wind in the soul resulted in the
        flightiness of the deer. An excess of atoms of heat, in turn, resulted
        in anger. Hot-tempered men were believed to be subject to sudden
        inrushes of heat which were capable of throwing them off balance and
        causing them to act for a time like madmen. According to Epicurus
        &quot;a fit of anger is a brief spell of insanity.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This line of reasoning was employed by him to explain
        the diversity in human character. This diversity was inconceivably great
        because the variety of differences in the atoms was beyond reckoning.
        The important point for the present inquiry, however, is the fact that
        the character of a man is subject to control and the key element for
        purposes of control is air. It is cool by nature and motionless, hostile
        to heat and motion. Its preponderance in the soul produces tranquillity
        in the breast and serenity of countenance, which was called ataraxy.
        This is confused in the best English dictionaries with Stoic apathy, a
        grave mistake. Apathy meant immunity to all emotions, which were thought
        to interfere with the verdicts of reason. Epicureans, however, had no
        distrust of normal emotions but only of upsetting emotions, such as
        fears.</p>
        <p align="justify">It follows that the secret of preserving the coveted
        tranquillity of soul depended upon the control of fears. If once the
        fears have been brought under control, the atoms of the disturbing
        elements, such as wind and heat, are expelled from the soul; their room
        is filled by the inert atoms of air and, to quote a phrase of Epicurus,
        &quot;every tumult of the soul is stilled.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">All of this theory, in Paul's time as commonplace as
        the contents of any high school textbook of physics today, was offensive
        enough because it was godless science and explained phenomena without
        divine causation; but what must have aroused Paul's scorn above all else
        was the teaching of Epicurus that the most upsetting of all fears were
        those of the gods and death. This was the implication of the two
        Authorized Doctrines which he placed at the head of the whole list, an
        eminence from which they became known to the ancient world as were
        perhaps no other texts.</p>
        <p align="justify">If this exposition be now brought to a point, it can
        be seen that Paul, with the true instinct of a satirist, knowing that
        satire is often better than argument, selects from the teachings of
        Epicurus the particular doctrine that lent itself to ridicule. He is
        scorning the idea that peace of mind, the tranquillity of the
        Epicureans, can be brought about by atomic control and he holds Epicurus
        up to scorn as the champion of such control.</p>
        <p align="justify">As is frequent in such satirical jabs, the meaning
        flickers between two senses; at one and the same time Paul ridicules
        Epicurus as the master of a creed and as the idolized master of a
        far-flung multitude of disciples, who so revered him even centuries
        after his death that disloyalty was denounced as patricide. It may not
        be irreverent to detect also a glimmer of jealousy, because the reader
        must be blind who cannot discern in Paul a greed for the very sort of
        dominance that Epicurus had achieved in life and had not lost in death.
        It is permissible, therefore, to accept the translation, &quot;the
        prince of the power of the air,&quot; if it be taken as a sneer.</p>
        <p align="justify">The correctness of the identification of Epicurus
        with &quot;the prince of the power of the air&quot; is confirmed by two
        phrases, the one that precedes it and the one that follows it. The
        former reads in the Revised Standard, &quot;following the course of this
        world,&quot; but the Greek reads, &quot;according to the generation of
        this world.&quot; The latter is correct and understandable; the
        Epicureans are &quot;the generation of this world&quot; because they
        deny the existence of any other than the physical world, and thereby
        deny the existence of a spiritual world such as Paul located in the
        heavenly regions.</p>
        <p align="justify">The second of the two confirmatory phrases reads,
        &quot;the spirit that now is at work in the sons of disobedience.&quot;
        The Epicureans are correctly described as &quot;sons of
        disobedience&quot; because they deny divine creationism as described in
        the <i>Book of Genesis</i>, reject the law and the prophets, and
        ridicule the idea of the second coming, the resurrection, and judgment.
        This item of designation occurs again in Ephesians 5:6, where Paul warns
        his readers against the persuasions of the Epicureans: &quot;Let no one
        deceive you with empty words, for it is because of these things that the
        wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.&quot; Another
        occurrence of the phrase may be found in Colossians 3:6 where the
        context helps to identify reference to the Epicureans.</p>
        <p align="justify">As a parting touch to this topic of &quot;the prince
        of the power of the air&quot; it should be recalled how vehemently Paul
        insists in his letters upon the resurrected Christ as the head of the
        whole structure of the church. This vehemence and insistence presumes
        the existence of a rival and contrary program and an unnamed adversary.
        In this present study the contrary program is identified as Epicurean
        materialism and the adversary as Epicurus. This opposition was more
        important to Paul than the opposition of orthodox Jews, because he was
        the apostle to the gentiles.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        The Fullness of Christ</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">It is assuredly no accident that in the very last
        sentence of the paragraph immediately preceding the mention of &quot;the
        generation of this world&quot; and &quot;the prince of the power of the
        air&quot; Paul writes of &quot;the fullness of him who fills all in
        all,&quot; and after an interval writes, in 4:13, of &quot;the mature
        manhood&quot; and &quot;the measure of the stature of the fullness of
        Christ.&quot; Strange as it may seem, or even farfetched, there are
        consecutive steps of logical connection between the concept of air as an
        agent of tranquility of soul and the concept of fullness as denoting
        attainment to godliness. It must always be carried in mind that Epicurus
        and Paul have this in common, that their ideas are regularly embedded in
        structures of thought and not offered as isolated bits of wisdom such as
        we know in the Book of Proverbs.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus and Paul had also this in common, that they
        conceived of the individual as progressing toward an appointed goal by
        definite steps or degrees, a notion that was shared with the mystery
        religions. In this teaching the Epicureans, as the older sect, enjoyed
        priority; one of their original textbooks bore the title, <i>On the
        Progress toward Wisdom. </i>The goal, it need hardly be said, may be
        variously described: in the case of the Epicureans it was wisdom or
        fullness of pleasure or approximation to the life of the gods; in the
        case of Paul it was knowledge of God or saintliness or likeness to
        Christ or fullness of Godhead.</p>
        <p align="justify">Now, strange as it may seem, or even startling, Paul
        teaches that one of these definite steps of progress toward the
        Christian's goal is to outgrow the belief in the philosophy of Epicurus
        and his atoms. In Galatians 4:3 he had written: &quot;When we were
        children we were slaves to the elements of the universe,&quot; that is,
        the atoms, which farther along in verse 9 he scorns as &quot;the weak
        and beggarly elements,&quot; as if serious truth could be built upon the
        contemptible atoms. In this passage the word <i>children,</i> as the
        context shows, signifies persons still short of mental maturity. It is
        just as if he were saying that belief in the atoms was excusable for
        adolescents but not for adults.</p>
        <p align="justify">If now we turn back the pages to Ephesians 2:1-2, we
        find that to outgrow Epicureanism is to pass from the death of sin to
        the life of the spirit. This is analogous to the passing from the
        minority of the spirit to true heirship in Christ, as set forth in
        Galatians. The figure of speech has been changed but the structure of
        thought is the same: to outgrow the belief in Epicurean materialism is a
        definite step in the progress toward the fullness of Godhead.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was not Paul, however, who first exalted fullness
        to the status of a blessed word. It must have been a thorn in his side
        that &quot;the prince of the power of the air&quot; had so often picked
        his words for him. At any rate he felt the necessity of giving much
        earnest study and thought to discovering for them new settings of
        significance.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was in connection with the concept of pleasure
        that fullness became a blessed word. Plato had sponsored the popular
        opinion that pleasures have no natural limit; they continually breed;
        the greater the indulgence the greater the need of indulgence. Epicurus,
        on the contrary, exalting Nature as the norm of truth, rightly called
        attention to the fact that natural limits had been set, the satisfaction
        of thirst and hunger being, for example, natural limits to the pleasure
        of drinking and eating. Consequently, if only a man be wise, the
        fullness of pleasure is possible, all natural pleasures being limited by
        natural ceilings.</p>
        <p align="justify">For another reason also the fullness of pleasure was
        declared possible. According to Epicurus the number of pleasures is
        limited and &quot;no new pleasure can be devised.&quot; Thus in a single
        lifetime the list of pleasures can be exhausted. Moreover, if fullness
        of pleasure has been once attained, he insisted, it cannot be increased
        by infinite time. This was part of the structure of thought by which he
        strove to reconcile men to mortality.</p>
        <p align="justify">Although this may perhaps have been sufficient to
        exalt pleasure to the status of a blessed word and capable of exercising
        a warming effect upon the mind, it was not the whole argument. There was
        still another floor to this edifice of thought. According to Epicurus
        there were two kinds of pleasure, the one kind being subject to addition
        and subtraction, which was human, the other being perfect, which was
        divine and characterized the life of the gods. It follows, therefore,
        that in proportion as human beings by wise and rational living attain to
        the fullness of pleasure they approximate to the life of gods.</p>
        <p align="justify">Moreover, on the physical side, this approximation to
        the life of the gods means the expulsion from the soul of all rebellious
        atoms, leaving a preponderance of the placid atoms of air. On this point
        it is worth the time to quote the text. The Epicurean poet Lucretius
        writes: &quot;This assurance I seem to be able to give in these matters,
        that so infinitesimal are the traces of our evil natures that reason
        cannot expel from the hearts of the wise that nothing prevents men from
        passing a life worthy of the gods.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If this whole structure of thought can be apprehended
        and kept in mind, it becomes imperative to observe a logical sequence of
        thought when Paul toward the end of the first chapter of this Epistle
        represents Christ as exalted &quot;above every name that is named&quot;
        and in the next chapter derides Epicurus as &quot;the prince of the
        power of the air.&quot; No two names were in those days so distinctly
        set against each other as those of Epicurus and Jesus; the very name <i>Epicurus</i>
        means &quot;helper&quot; or &quot;succorer&quot; in Greek and multitudes
        of men revered him as a savior. It was to distinguish the disciples of
        Jesus from the disciples of Epicurus that they were called Christians.
        The two sects were unique in being named for their founders.</p>
        <p align="justify">To return to our argument, we should recognize the
        logic of Paul's procedure when in the first chapter he works up to a
        climax and caps it with the words, &quot;the fullness of him who fills
        all in all,&quot; and promptly turns to the task of pulling Epicurus
        down from the pagan eminence.</p>
        <p align="justify">This is not the end, however; the argument marches
        on. The Epistle is constructed after the manner of a Greek victory ode,
        approaching the theme and then receding from it as if in harmony with
        stirring music and the progression and recession of a chorus of dancers.
        In 4:13 the progression of thought arrives once more at a climax and one
        of loftier elevation: until we all attain &quot;to mature manhood, to
        the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Incidentally, Paul works in the domain of doctrine
        after the same fashion as ancient architects, who tore down pagan
        temples in order to build Christian churches. The older structure
        furnished material for the new. Paul demolishes philosophy in order to
        build up religion.</p>
        <p align="justify">To return once more to the argument, the scheme of
        thought repeats itself. Just as the name of Christ had been exalted and
        the name of Epicurus anonymously belittled, so now the words
        &quot;mature manhood and the measure of the stature of the fullness of
        Christ&quot; are immediately followed by the words &quot;so that we may
        no longer be children.&quot; This is one of the three passages where the
        creed of Epicurus is scorned as something to capture the immature, the
        college boys and girls, as we may say. One passage, already cited, is in
        Galatians 4:3: &quot;when we were children we were slaves to the
        elements of the universe,&quot; that is, &quot;the weak and beggarly
        elements,&quot; the atoms. The third is in First Corinthians 13:11:
        &quot;When I was a child, I spoke like a child,&quot; of which a fuller
        interpretation will be offered in its proper context.</p>
        <p align="justify">The present mention of children, however, is followed
        by words that tempt to further inquiry: &quot;tossed to and fro and
        carried about by every wind of doctrine.&quot; It is curious that
        Epicurus had written something very similar, and, as usual, it was part
        of one of his structures of thought. Since he denied immortality, it
        followed that the present life could not be viewed as a preparation for
        a finer life after death, as it was to Plato and ought to be for
        Christians, but was rather a preparation for a happy old age, as modern
        society tends to believe. Old age was thus the haven or harbor of the
        voyage of life.</p>
        <p align="justify">The beautiful words of Epicurus on this topic run as
        follows: &quot;It is not the young man who is to be thought happy, but
        rather the old man who has lived the good life; for the young man, led
        astray by his high spirits, <i>as a general thing drifts at the mercy of
        chance,</i> but the old man has cast anchor in old age as in a haven,
        locking in a grateful memory the recollection of blessings he had no
        right to count upon.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">With the words in italics compare those of Paul,
        &quot;tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of
        doctrine.&quot; Both men are describing the age of adolescence.</p>
        <p align="justify">This slight coincidence, it is granted, is no proof
        that Paul was familiar with the words of Epicurus but scores of such
        specimens can be assembled, and even small probabilities can add up to
        certainty. Paul seems to have been disposed toward Epicureanism as was
        the illustrious Cicero. Both of them continued to feel the pull of the
        enticing persuasiveness, the <i>suavitas,</i> as St. Augustine called
        it, which filled whole cities with disciples.</p>
        <p align="justify">Both men also stood in fear of that very
        persuasiveness. It was for this reason that Cicero in his old age
        reverted to orthodoxy and denounced the alluring creed of the hedonistic
        Sirens. It was for a like reason that Paul continued to warn his
        converts of their &quot;enticing words&quot; or &quot;beguiling
        speech.&quot; In this instance, Ephesians 4:14, the warning is against
        &quot;the cunning of men&quot; and &quot;their craftiness in deceitful
        wiles.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It is tempting, however, to seek greater precision in
        the translation of these phrases. Paul by his choice of words would have
        us think of suave gamblers who lie in wait for the unsuspecting
        adolescent with loaded dice, unscrupulous as to the means of their
        deception.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurean teachings, however, had a way of recurring
        to the mind of Paul. No sooner has he warned his readers against the
        persuasiveness of the competitor than he counsels them, 4:15:
        &quot;Rather, speaking the truth in love.&quot; What this means will be
        more precisely understood if it be recognized as a specialty of the
        Epicureans. Each of their groups was a mutual education society and each
        member was required to submit to correction without animus. The
        Epicureans had their own schools, an example which the Christians
        copied, and in these the first objective was to habituate the child to
        take correction kindly. The teacher was to be actuated solely by a
        desire to advance the good of the pupil and was warned against taking
        any misconduct as an affront to himself. He is warned against reviling,
        jeering, or injuring feelings.</p>
        <p align="justify">On this topic we still possess in extensive fragments
        the Epicurean textbook, of which the title may be interpreted <i>On
        Speaking the Truth</i>, by Philodemus of Gadara. It may very well have
        been known to Paul.</p>
        <p align="justify">How persistently the problem of combatting
        Epicureanism exercised the kind of Paul<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        is immediately evidenced again. No sooner has he exhorted
        his followers (4:15) &quot;to grow up in every way into him who is the
        head, into Christ,&quot; than he turns to warning again in verse 17
        (Revised Standard) against living &quot;as the gentiles do, in the
        futility of their minds.&quot; The King James has &quot;vanity&quot;
        instead of &quot;futility.&quot; The latter is preferable but greater
        precision is possible.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Greek word which is so translated is one of
        several that do not occur in the Gospels but are used by both Paul and
        the Epicureans. To the latter the corresponding adjective meant
        &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;nonsensical&quot;; it was a word of ridicule.
        For example, one of the sayings of Epicurus runs: &quot;It is silly to
        pray to the gods for something a man is capable of obtaining for
        himself.&quot; Another saying reads: &quot;Those who say the soul is by
        nature incorporeal are talking nonsense.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">From statements such as these, which are on record,
        it is easy to infer that the Epicureans had been treating the whole
        program of Paul's evangelism with ridicule: they would have been saying
        that the prediction of the second coming, the judgment, and the
        resurrection of the dead were all silliness. Consequently, when Paul
        writes of &quot;the silliness of their minds,&quot; he is merely
        answering ridicule with ridicule and hurling back at his adversaries one
        of their own grenades. That this ridicule, however, was the cause of
        bitter concern to him may be discerned from First Corinthians, where
        &quot;to the Greeks foolishness&quot; or something similar is found five
        times.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Nurture and Admonition</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">From the ethical advice and exhortation that Paul
        sets down for his readers verse 6:4 may be singled out for special
        comment: &quot;Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring
        them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord&quot; (Revised
        Standard); the King James reads &quot;nurture and admonition.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">There is more here than meets the eye and, as so
        often in Paul's writing, what does not meet the eye may be dug up from
        texts of Epicurus. It will be recalled that the latter in his first
        Authorized Doctrine declared the divine being to be incapable of anger.
        To this it may be added that he held up the life of the gods as a model
        to be imitated, including this immunity to anger.</p>
        <p align="justify">How Paul appropriated this doctrine, changed the
        motivation, and presented it as his own teaching may be observed in this
        Epistle 5:1-2: &quot;Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.
        And <i>walk in love,</i> as Christ loved us and gave himself up for
        us.&quot; This is characteristic of Paul: he takes an idea from Greek
        philosophy, elaborates it, embellishes it, remotivates it, and presents
        it as something new.</p>
        <p align="justify">After this brief detour it will be possible to return
        to &quot;the nurture and admonition of the Lord&quot; with better
        prospects of precise and fruitful interpretation. If men are to imitate
        the divine being, as Epicurus recommended, and to become &quot;imitators
        of God,&quot; as Paul enjoins, and &quot;walk in love,&quot; as both
        advised, they will neither give way to anger themselves nor by
        displaying anger provoke their children to anger. Like the good
        Epicurean teacher, they will be actuated solely by the good of the
        child.</p>
        <p align="justify">As for &quot;nurture and admonition,&quot; the key
        word is <i>admonition,</i> which, counting the verb <i>admonish,</i>
        occurs twelve times in Pauline writings and nowhere else in the New
        Testament. With Epicurus it is technical and signifies the gentlest sort
        of instruction in conduct, free from rebuke or reprimand and
        characterized by timely suggestion rather than sharp imperatives. It is
        consequently at the sacrifice of accuracy that the Revised Standard
        drops the word admonition. The accurate version would read &quot;the
        instruction and <i>admonition</i> of the Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus a commendable item of procedure is taken over
        from philosophy and transmitted to us under the label of religion. This
        phenomenon is not singular; various borrowings from Epicureanism were
        made by the Stoics and come down to us under their labels.</p>

        This Present Darkness</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Concerning other ethical precepts of this letter the
        place for comment will be elsewhere in this study. However, there is one
        remarkable verse, 6:12, which calls for immediate explanation. In the
        whole Epistle there is a certain alternation of movement, a
        reciprocation between admonition and warning, but this final example of
        it possesses major interest. It forms a sort of final climax. Paul
        usually contrives, like the Epicurean poet Lucretius, to finish each
        piece with a passage that is apt to find lodgment in the memory forever.
        The verse that here calls for interpretation reads: &quot;For we are not
        contending against flesh and blood, but against the principalities,
        against the powers, against the world rulers of this present darkness,
        against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This is one of the passages that have seemed to
        justify scholars in regarding Paul as a mystic. It does not follow,
        however, that Paul was a mystic because scholars are mystified. The real
        trouble may be that the key to the mystery has not been found.</p>
        <p align="justify">The first problem is to determine the meaning of the
        word <i>principalities.</i> The Greek is <i>archai,</i> one of those
        shifty terms of which the meaning depends upon the context. To the
        translators of 1611 it seemed to mean &quot;principalities&quot; and
        their choice has planted a prejudice in the minds of their successors.
        The real question, however, is not what the word seemed to mean in 1611
        but what it actually meant to readers when Paul wrote it, in the first
        century A.D. To readers of that time, when the lore of the atoms of
        Epicurus was as much a part of the public mind as the lore of atoms and
        atomic fission is a part of the public mind at this moment, the word
        would have signified atoms. The root meaning is &quot;beginning&quot;
        and the atoms were the beginnings of all things according to Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">What, then, can Paul be meaning when he declares the
        contest to be not against flesh and blood but against the atoms? The
        answer is easy: he means that the real enemy is an ideology.</p>
        <p align="justify">It remains to discover how the remaining terms of the
        list will fit into this interpretation. What is meant by the second:
        &quot;against the powers&quot;? This word has been explained already,
        when &quot;the prince of the power of the air&quot; was under scrutiny.
        The word power signified the fixed potency, <i>finita potestas,</i> as
        Lucretius has it, which characterized each particular variety of atom,
        in modern chemistry the valence. For example, atoms like those of air
        always tended to produce tranquillity; those resembling the atoms of
        wind always tended to produce motion, and so on with each sort.</p>
        <p align="justify">So this interpretation of the word powers is quite in
        harmony with the interpretation of the previous word as
        &quot;atoms.&quot; There is no need to see mysticism. What should be
        discerned is the religionist's scorn of science and its terminology.</p>
        <p align="justify">So far, very good, but what about &quot;the rulers of
        the darkness of this world,&quot; or &quot;the world rulers of this
        present darkness,&quot; according as the King James or the Revised
        Standard is preferred? These are everyday words but in combination they
        evoke no click of understanding in the mind of the modern reader. This
        failure is due to the obsolescence of certain reflexes of thought to
        which Paul's readers were conditioned and we are not.</p>
        <p align="justify">The clue to these obsolete reflexes, however, may be
        found in the teachings of Epicurus, which it has long been the fashion
        to ignore.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this instance the pursuit of the clue will be very
        rewarding, because it will bring to light a fundamental paradox of
        popular thought in Paul's time, which occurs not infrequently in his
        Epistles. This paradox hinges upon the figurative use of the words <i>darkness</i>
        and <i>light</i> to denote respectively states of sin and salvation.
        This reciprocal metaphor has become for us so staled by frequence as to
        deflect from itself all critical attention. It may consequently be
        somewhat startling to bring to notice that the Epicureans made
        figurative use of these same words <i>darkness</i> and <i>light</i> to
        denote the very opposites: religion was darkness and to be saved from
        religion was emergence to light. It was the boast of Epicureans that
        their founder had emancipated mankind from the yoke of religion.</p>
        <p align="justify">The first book of the Epicurean poet Lucretius begins
        with a description of mankind &quot;lying prostrate upon the earth,
        foully crushed beneath the burden of religion,&quot; and the third book
        apostrophizes Epicurus as &quot;the glory of the Grecian race, who out
        of such profound darkness was the first to succeed in raising aloft so
        brilliant a torch of light that men could see what made life worth
        living.&quot; This light which was raised aloft, it is needless to
        insist, was the light of natural science, with its atoms and their
        powers.</p>
        <p align="justify">Now this crisscrossing of metaphors, religion being
        dubbed as darkness by the one sect and exalted as light by the other, is
        not merely astonishing but also fruitful of consequence. It again puts
        Epicurus in the position of Antichrist, whom Paul never names, though he
        sponsors the concept.</p>
        <p align="justify">Moreover, to advance the argument a stage farther,
        the effect of the teaching of Epicurus was to dethrone the gods, though
        not to abolish them; they were to be relegated to a retired life, as it
        were, free to enjoy absolute happiness, worried by no responsibility,
        and unconcerned about human wickedness. Thus, insofar as he dethroned
        the gods -- and this would apply to Jehovah as soon as Epicureanism had
        invaded Palestine -- he exalted himself above them. Hence Paul writes in
        Second Thessalonians 2:4: &quot;who opposeth and exalteth himself above
        all that is called God,&quot; quite rightly discerning that all gods
        fare equally ill at the hand of Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">When once the argument has been advanced to this
        point, there is no longer reason to be mystified about the meaning of
        Ephesians 6:12, &quot;against the world rulers of the present
        darkness.&quot; A brief chain argument will sum up the case: if the
        Epicureans would dethrone all gods, Jehovah included, and retire them to
        inactivity, then they exalt themselves above the gods; and if they exalt
        themselves above the gods, they may well be styled ironically as
        &quot;world rulers&quot; themselves. Epicurus himself, as the principal,
        may well be described as &quot;the man of lawlessness&quot; and his
        disciples as &quot;the sons of disobedience.&quot; Would they not have
        abolished the Ten Commandments along with the rest of the law? If for
        the law and the prophets are to be substituted the writings of Epicurus,
        including his forty Authorized Doctrines, then as lawmakers as well as
        usurpers the Epicureans would have qualified themselves for the derisive
        epithet of &quot;world rulers.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul is retorting to ridicule with a more elaborate
        and more devastating ridicule; he is outmocking the mockers. Words often
        lose their voltage in translation and this is particularly true of words
        of derision. The word that we feebly render as &quot;world rulers,&quot;
        when read in the Greek tongue, may be felt to detonate with a veritable
        blast of scorn; it is a big compound noun, polysyllabic, sonorous, and
        contemptuous, rare at best and used only here in the New Testament. It
        hints at the alleged arrogance of the Epicureans.</p>
        <p align="justify">Moreover, when Paul writes of &quot;this
        darkness,&quot; it is almost as if he were putting this phrase in
        quotation marks; he refers to the fact that to these arrogant
        adversaries religion is darkness. It is even possible that it was from
        Paul that his faithful Luke picked up the potent idea, found only in his
        Gospel, 11:35: &quot;the light that is in them is darkness.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Of four designations of the adversaries only one
        remains. In the King James Version it reads: &quot;spiritual wickedness
        in high places.&quot; This belongs to the class of mistranslations that
        endear themselves to Bible readers; it is astonishing how apt a
        mistranslation can be to certain circumstances. The Revised Standard
        hints at a mystical meaning, though edging closer to the truth:
        &quot;the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.&quot;
        Unluckily there is nothing in the Greek text to demand the word <i>hosts</i>
        and the suggestion of mysticism ought to put us on guard. Paul's
        references are usually specific.</p>
        <p align="justify">This specific reference may be found in the same
        source from which we have drawn our solutions to the other enigmas of
        this compacted verse, which would have been no enigmas to contemporary
        readers.</p>
        <p align="justify">A literal translation would read: &quot;the
        spirituality of wickedness in the heavenly regions.&quot; It was the
        teaching of Epicurus that the world we live in and other worlds
        resembling it in the infinite universe were areas of imperfection and
        corruption, and that in the spaces between these worlds, not unaptly
        described here as &quot;heavenly regions,&quot; was an area where
        perfection and incorruption prevailed. In this area was located the
        abode of &quot;the blessed and incorruptible being&quot; which Epicurus
        refers to in the first of his Authorized Doctrines.</p>
        <p align="justify">To this concept of the divine being Paul could not
        deny all merit, because this being was represented as partial to pious
        and reverent human beings and as offering them a sort of fellowship; but
        there was something ascribed to it that horrified him: total
        indifference toward human wickedness. What could be more wicked than
        indifference toward wickedness? Hence we have this blasting figure of
        speech, the phrase that contradicts itself, &quot;the spirituality of
        wickedness in the heavenly regions.&quot;</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        The Logic of Opposites</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The time has now come for the synoptic survey of this
        Epistle. If we would clinch our understanding of it, the procedure of
        reasoning from opposite to opposite should be singled out for exclusive
        attention. This has been mentioned already but a striking example may
        serve to bring our conception of it into sharper focus. When the Moslem
        says, &quot;The Lord God is one God and Mohammed is his prophet,&quot;
        he is denying the Doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus. In
        other words, unless the divinity of Jesus and the Doctrine of the
        Trinity had won recognition, the Moslem could never have denied them.
        The one religion was born of the other through the force of repulsion.</p>
        <p align="justify">Similarly, if the philosophy of Epicurus had not
        flourished in advance of Christianity, then Christianity as Paul
        constructed it would not have existed. The form it was given by him was
        due to the force of opposition and repulsion. The very name of Christian
        was bestowed upon the disciples to distinguish them from the followers
        of Epicurus. The adherents of no other sects were named for their
        founders.</p>
        <p align="justify">No time should be lost in fortifying this general
        statement by examples. When Paul insisted that Christ was the head of
        the church, he was endeavoring to habituate his readers to the thought
        that the community he was setting up was no mere school of philosophy
        headed by a mortal man, such as Epicurus, no matter how gifted, but a
        divine institution and headed by a divine man, whose exaltation to the
        right hand of God was an historical fact.</p>
        <p align="justify">Next, when he proposed to exalt the name of this
        divine man Christ &quot;above every name that is named,&quot; the fact
        that the name of the Antichrist, as it were, which was in his mind at
        the moment was no other than Epicurus is demonstrated by his immediate
        effort to depress the prestige of this Epicurus as &quot;the prince of
        the power of the air,&quot; as if the happiness of mankind could depend
        upon paltry atoms, &quot;weak and beggarly elements.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Recapitulation of additional examples will be
        justified if it serves to inculcate an unfamiliar habit of thought. When
        Paul writes in this Epistle of &quot;the fullness of him who fills all
        in all&quot; and &quot;the fullness of God,&quot; he would never have so
        written were he not opposing this blessed concept to &quot;the fullness
        of pleasure,&quot; which to Epicurus was fullness of life.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet again, when he describes the climax of the
        Christian experience as attainment &quot;to mature manhood,&quot; he
        would never have been moved to choose this particular phrase had he not
        been insisting, as in Galatians and First Corinthians, that to accept
        the atomism of Epicurus was meet only for the irresponsible age of
        adolescence.</p>
        <p align="justify">From the topic of repulsion to the topic of satire
        the transition is easy. When Epicurus, after a taste of persecution,
        resolved to make a weapon of ridicule, which was not an indictable
        offense, he became a satirist and he encouraged the practice among his
        followers. One of them enraged the Platonists by writing a burlesque
        account of Socrates. Paul too, the ex-Epicurean, identifies himself
        squarely with this tradition; when he dubs Epicurus &quot;the prince of
        the power of the air,&quot; this is pure satire. It is pure satire also
        and that too with an exquisite refinement when, toward the close of this
        Epistle, he resorts to the ambiguous words which may be rendered
        &quot;principalities and powers&quot; but in the Greek language can just
        as well mean &quot;atoms and their fixed potencies.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The Epistle is all of a piece, carefully planned, and
        in effect an elaborate specimen of satirical writing, interlarded with
        friendly exhortation and admonition, purloined from the plenteous
        ethical stores of the very teacher that is satirized. The forces of
        attraction and repulsion work simultaneously.</p>
        <p align="justify">As a last word, it may be added that if this Epistle
        was really addressed to the Ephesians, we shall be moved to recall the
        words of the biographer of Epicurus, who speaks of his friends as being
        &quot;counted by whole cities.&quot; To have composed a blistering,
        though not unartful or untasteful, blast of satire against a man who was
        not known to multitudes would be hardly conceivable.

        The Logic of the Cross</font></p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4">T</font><font size="2">HE</font> heading of this chapter has
        been chosen with deliberation. In the light of the content of this
        Epistle it would seem that what we have been accustomed to know in the
        King James Version as &quot;the preaching of the cross&quot; and now
        read in the Revised Standard as &quot;the word of the cross,&quot; in
        reality means &quot;the logic of the cross&quot; as opposed to what we
        may call &quot;the logic of the atom.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The keynote is struck in the first chapter: Paul
        pours scorn upon philosophy and in chilling irony refers to the atoms in
        verse 28 as &quot;things that are,&quot; because Epicurus asserted them
        to be the ultimate existences; to these he opposes &quot;things that are
        not,&quot; such as the faith, hope, and love of the illustrious
        thirteenth chapter. In the second chapter he sets up the new canon of
        truth, spiritual insight, in direct opposition to the famous canon of
        Epicurus. In the fifteenth, a grand finale, he expounds his doctrine of
        the soul and immortality, employing Epicurean terminology and reasonings
        in order to reason Epicurus out of court.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is well to take Paul at his word. It is in this
        Epistle, 9:22, that he informs us: &quot;I have become all things to all
        men that I might by all means save some.&quot; If, then, he became
        &quot;as a Greek to the Greek,&quot; we are assuming that he became as
        an Epicurean to the Epicurean. The other Greek philosophies were
        offering no competition. Platonism was always for the intellectual few.
        Neither were the followers of Aristotle numerous and their interest was
        less in human beings than in plants and animals. Stoicism with its high
        pretentious attracted the &quot;silk-cushion&quot; class and
        disqualified itself for the multitude by its asperity.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was the ingratiating friendliness and suavity of
        the ubiquitous Epicureans that Paul especially feared and emulated, with
        which they made their neatly integrated and clearly written theories
        acceptable to the multitudes and especially to the middle class, the
        thrifty and industrious bourgeois. This suavity was defined by Cicero as
        &quot;an agreeableness of speech and manners,&quot; but it also hints at
        persuasiveness; nor is there any Epistle of Paul that exhibits this
        quality to a higher degree than certain chapters of this first Epistle
        to the Corinthians.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul had received a liberal education. In this
        Epistle, 14:18, he writes: &quot;I thank God that I speak in tongues
        more than you all.&quot; He was fortunate in the place of his birth.
        Tarsus was the gateway to Asia Minor from the south and in point of
        celebrity in the East was inferior only to Antioch and Alexandria. As
        part of his education the youthful Paul would have received instruction
        in rhetoric, as his writings amply testify. It is also likely that he
        was introduced to Greek philosophy by his teacher of rhetoric. It was a
        common procedure for the same instructor to handle both branches,
        devoting the morning to philosophy and the afternoon to speech. Neither
        was it uncommon for this instructor to be an Epicurean. It is true that
        the sect discouraged the political career but it is not true that they
        despised the arts of speech. Their devotion to the art of persuasion
        determined this choice in advance.</p>
        <p align="justify">When we turn to Paul's actual procedures we must be
        on our guard against his beguilements. It is part of his artfulness to
        conceal his art. Very soon after his affectionate salutation he begins
        to disavow all knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy, 1:17: &quot;For
        Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with
        eloquent wisdom.&quot; As if this disavowal might fail to register
        itself, he repeats it presently, 2:1: &quot;I did not come to you
        proclaiming the mystery of God in lofty words or wisdom.&quot; As if
        this repetition would not suffice, he hammers upon the point with a
        third assertion, 2:4: &quot;and my speech and my message were not in
        plausible words of wisdom.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This is mere literary irony and its purpose is to
        forestall any impression of superiority that might diminish the
        acceptability of the message. In point of fact he is about to do the
        very things he disavows; he will be writing artfully and in this very
        same second chapter he will set up a canon of truth, which is a concept
        of sheer philosophy.</p>
        <p align="justify">On this topic of philosophy a few more words may be
        helpful. Wherever Paul uses the word <i>wisdom</i> by itself he means
        Greek philosophy. It is one of those opposites in which his thinking
        abounds; it is opposed to &quot;the wisdom of God.&quot; In verse 1:20
        his scorn of it becomes explicit: &quot;Where is the wise man? Where is
        the scribe? Where is the debater of this age?&quot; This pattern of
        rhetorical sentence is an idiom of contempt and disparagement, as we may
        observe also in the question of the scoffer in Second Peter 3:4:
        &quot;Where is the promise of his coming?&quot; It is just as if Paul
        had written: &quot;Of what use is the philosopher? Of what use is the
        man of learning? Of what use is the researcher?&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Concerning this word researcher a note of
        justification is in order. It suggests the force that the words disputer
        and debater of the King James and Revised Standard Versions would have
        carried for the ancients, whose only concept of research was a staged
        debate between contestants in the presence of others, after the manner
        of Socrates, the so-called science of dialectic. In practice this
        degenerated rapidly into sheer exhibitionism but continued to enjoy high
        popularity. To Paul it was mere &quot;arguing about words, good for no
        useful end, ruinous to the hearers,&quot; as he warns in Second Timothy
        2:14.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this quotation the word hearers calls for a note.
        In the Greek language it signifies by implication &quot;students&quot;
        and thus Paul is virtually saying that &quot;arguing about words is
        ruinous to students.&quot; It happens also that Epicurus long before had
        denounced dialecticians as &quot;wholesale corrupters,&quot; that is, of
        young men. We may well accustom ourselves to finding Paul in agreement
        with Epicurus on many particulars even while denouncing philosophy, the
        &quot;wisdom of the world,&quot; in general.</p>
        <p align="justify">He does denounce it frequently and he wishes the
        members of his churches to become prejudiced against it. Yet at the very
        same time it is no part of his intention to reason after the fashion of
        a Jewish prophet, nor even, for example, as Jesus did, but rather after
        the manner of a Greek philosopher. He is planning to build up &quot;the
        logic of the cross&quot; into a coherent structure of doctrine to the
        end that the truth which in the beginning was received in faith may be
        confirmed by reason. This &quot;logic of the cross&quot; must be so
        presented as to rival and replace the logic of the atom.</p>
        <p align="justify">Even on the topic of rhetoric a brief note may be in
        place. Paul, in spite of his disavowals of eloquence, exhibits abundant
        knowledge of the rules. In this Epistle we should observe, for instance,
        how he alternately makes sharp demands upon the attention of the reader
        and then relaxes it. Not to press the details unduly, the first three
        chapters, the thirteenth, and the fifteenth call for close
        concentration, while in the intervals the demand for attention is
        somewhat relaxed; nor in this planned spacing is it to be overlooked
        that he takes care to end magnificently in the illustrious fifteenth, a
        veritable peroration. He is a practiced rhetorician.</p>

        The Things That Are Not</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">If now we have penetrated the disguises of Paul and
        realize that he is practicing the arts of writing and reasoning as
        taught in the Greek schools at the very same time that he is disavowing
        knowledge of them, we shall be prepared to profit by a scrutiny of
        details.</p>
        <p align="justify">Toward the end of the first chapter he exults that
        God has chosen the foolish in the world to shame the wise, the weak to
        shame the strong, and the low and despised, &quot;even things that are
        not, to bring to nothing things that are.&quot; The key to this dark
        phraseology is recognition of the fact that &quot;the things that
        are&quot; in the language of Epicurus means the atoms, ta onta in the
        Greek. This is irony; according to Epicurus these atoms, apart from
        space, were the sole real existences; out of them all things were made
        and into them all things could be dissolved.</p>
        <p align="justify">Now, if this principle be accepted, what becomes of
        such things as faith, hope, and love? This is an old, old problem,
        thoroughly threshed out in antiquity and rethrashed in modern
        philosophy. The answer is that such things as faith, hope, and love
        would be reduced to unreality, mere names, empty of meaning,
        corresponding to no concrete existence. The example most bandied about
        in ancient times was that of virtue, so much flaunted by the Stoics. For
        instance, the last words of Marcus Brutus became a classic; before
        committing suicide he is said to have lamented: &quot;Unhappy virtue! So
        you were just a name, after all, and I followed thee as something
        real.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It matters little that this reasoning is a fallacy
        and that Epicurus knew the answer. If the material atom is the sole and
        ultimate existence, then virtue can have no existence; this inference
        becomes a necessity of thought. A necessity of thought, however, is not
        a necessity of reality, much less of action. The human mind is dominated
        by abstractions in spite of the fact that they cannot be contained in a
        test tube.</p>
        <p align="justify">The fallacy, however, was demonstrable only to the
        few, while the slur was valid for the disparagement of atomism in the
        minds of the many, which was the objective of Paul. For the modern
        reader the essential thing to observe is the fact that in scorning
        &quot;the things that are&quot; Paul is scorning the atoms.</p>

        Paul's Canon of Truth</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">An excellent specimen of persuasiveness joined with
        apt concealment of art may be observed in the second chapter of this
        Epistle, where Paul sets up his new canon of truth. In point of fact the
        concealment is so neat that even the Epicurean reader of that day may
        have been persuaded to accept Paul's reasoning without being aware that
        the canon of truth as enunciated by Epicurus himself was being replaced
        by one of Paul's invention. As for the modern reader, he may be in the
        predicament of missing the meaning entirely, because the teachings of
        Epicurus are no longer part of our common knowledge, nor even included
        in the knowledge of the learned.</p>
        <p align="justify">As things now stand, it is much as if Paul had
        written in cipher and the task before us is one of decipherment.
        Fortunately this decipherment is quite possible and the reward will be
        found in clearer understanding and more precise translations.</p>
        <p align="justify">It goes without saying that every serious thinker
        must possess some criterion of truth. For the majority of Greek thinkers
        this criterion was reason but it was something taken for granted and not
        spelled out in a dogma. Epicurus, the first dogmatic philosopher, took
        care to spell out his criterion and give it to the world in a document,
        a brief treatise entitled Canon. This word signifies in its concrete
        sense a rule or straightedge by which a builder tests the exactness of
        his work. The choice of this word should remind us that Epicurus
        conceived of sound thinking as an operation to be characterized by
        precision, analogous to exact procedures in the erection of a building.
        This concept is elaborated by his disciple Lucretius, who mentions also
        the level and plumb line.</p>
        <p align="justify">We should also do well to remember that Paul's mind
        is prepossessed by a similar analogy. Witness his frequent use of the
        word <i>build</i> or <i>build up</i> and especially his addiction to the
        word edify, which, save for an example in Acts, he alone employs in the
        New Testament. By this very frequency the meaning of the word has been
        so washed out that few readers are prompted to recall its original
        significance, &quot;to build a house,&quot; which holds true also for
        its Greek equivalent. Thus edifying means &quot;constructive.&quot; At
        the moment, however, the point to bear in mind is the extent to which
        Paul resembles Epicurus in certain drifts of thought. This resemblance
        may be discerned in his elucidation of his new canon of truth.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Canon of Epicurus was not only the first document
        of its kind but was also one of the neatest packages of doctrine ever
        assembled by human acumen and ingenuity. He thought of the mind as a
        central organ which registers and processes the messages conveyed to it
        by the five senses, by the feelings of pleasure and pain, and by the
        innate ideas, which, as if instinctive, exist in advance of experience
        and so anticipate it. Thus there were three criteria of truth:
        Sensations, Feelings, and Anticipations.</p>
        <p align="justify">Such, in brief, was the package of doctrine but among
        educated people of the time the Sensations had come to stand for the
        whole package, especially for the reason that this criterion was the
        most open to attack by the Platonists and Stoics, who exalted reason as
        a criterion. Among the Sensations, in turn, the sense of sight is so
        superior to the remaining four that even it was on occasion made to
        stand for the whole package, as in Colossians 2:18, &quot;taking his
        stand on what he has seen, puffed up without justification by the mind
        of the flesh.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">That the Sensations as criteria were hovering in the
        mind of Paul as he was erecting his new canon of truth in First
        Corinthians 2 is made certain in verse 9: &quot;What eye hath not seen
        nor ear heard nor ever entered into the mind of man, all that God has
        prepared for them that love him, God has revealed to us through the
        Spirit.&quot; In this quotation we should observe the mention of eye and
        ear and recall that sight and hearing are foremost among the criteria of
        Epicurus; neither should we miss the point that the mind in question is
        &quot;the mind of the flesh,&quot; because it was the teaching of
        Epicurus that the mind was an organ of the body just as the eyes or the
        ears.</p>
        <p align="justify">To have hit upon these verses of Isaiah (64:4 and
        65:17) must have afforded to Paul an exquisite satisfaction. It
        furnishes Old Testament authority for rejecting both the Epicurean
        criteria and the Epicurean psychology while at the same time naming the
        new criterion, the spirit, which we may call spiritual insight. The
        implied inference is made explicit in the verse following: &quot;For the
        Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.&quot; Here it may be
        more precise for the sake of the emphasis to read the verse as follows:
        &quot;For it is the Spirit that searches everything.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It may now seem ironical that Paul, after scorning
        the criteria of Epicurus, should proceed to reason about his new
        criterion after the fashion of Epicurus. The latter reasoned as follows:
        Nothing can refute the sensations; they cannot refute one another. To
        invent an example, if the nose registers the odor of peppermint, the
        ears cannot contradict it. Conversely, if the ears register recognition
        of a melody, the nose cannot contradict them. Neither can the mind
        contradict the nose or the ears, because by itself it is not cognizant
        of odors or melodies but depends upon the senses for its information of
        such. Each of the senses, then, possesses exclusive authority over the
        phenomena of which it is cognizant and by virtue of this fact gains the
        status of a criterion. Nothing can refute them.</p>
        <p align="justify">Now this is precisely the sort of authority that Paul
        claims for spiritual insight, verse 15: &quot;The spiritual man judges
        all things but is himself judged by no one.&quot; Thus spiritual insight
        is set up as a criterion of truth, subject to the test of no other
        criterion. We must consequently correct the translation of the sentence
        that follows and instead of &quot;For who has known the mind of the Lord
        so as to instruct him,&quot; we had better read, &quot;so as to put it
        to the proof.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Having by this time clearly apprehended that Paul,
        like Epicurus before him, is setting up a canon of truth, we become
        qualified to make another correction. Verse 13 runs as follows in the
        Revised Standard: &quot;And we impart this in words not taught by human
        wisdom but taught by the Spirit, <i>interpreting spiritual truths to
        those who possess the Spirit</i>.&quot; Of the phrase in italics two
        alternative versions are offered in a footnote, all three being
        erroneous. The Greek word which is here rendered
        &quot;interpreting&quot; is employed by Epicurus and others in the sense
        of &quot;matching,&quot; and we arrive at the true meaning by reading,
        &quot;matching the spiritual with the spiritual.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In other words, the criterion that is employed must
        &quot;match&quot; the truth that is tested; on the level of spiritual
        truth the criterion of spiritual insight alone is valid. It is tacitly
        allowed that on other levels of thought other criteria may possess
        validity, such as the criteria of sight and hearing on the sensory
        level, but on the spiritual level the sole criterion is spiritual
        insight, the gift of God.</p>
        <p align="justify">Even a minor error of translation may be worth
        correction. The Revised Standard renders verse 14 as follows: &quot;The
        unspiritual man does not receive the gifts of the Spirit of God, for
        they are folly to him.&quot; The error here is one that frequently
        occurs, mistaking an idiom of characterization for a statement of fact.
        Epicurus writes in similar language &quot;that the gods are receptive
        toward men resembling themselves.&quot; So we may improve our
        translation by reading: &quot;The unspiritual man is unreceptive toward
        the gifts of the Spirit of God.&quot; Paul is informing us how the lack
        of the proper criterion reacts upon the individual; he becomes
        prejudiced in advance against spiritual truths because according to his
        own criteria they are folly.</p>

        Epicurus and Paul and the Soul</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The illustrious fifteenth chapter of First
        Corinthians, where Paul touches his highest point, whether of eloquence
        or reasoning, is still marred by some imprecisions of interpretation.
        These may be cured by recognition of the fact that he is arguing against
        the Epicureans, whose ridicule concentrated itself upon the prophecy of
        the resurrection, just as their logic of the atom claimed the maximum of
        certainty for itself in denying immortality. Here, as nowhere else so
        manifestly, may we discern this logic of the atom in competition with
        the logic of the cross.</p>
        <p align="justify">The explanation of these residual obscurities may be
        found in certain assumptions of Paul, which were justified in his day as
        matters of common knowledge, though long since lost from view in a
        despised and neglected tradition of learning. Foremost among these
        neglected items of tradition is the Epicurean lore of the soul, of which
        the key word in Paul's language is <i>psychikos</i> in Greek, that is,
        &quot;psychic,&quot; but utterly different in force from our modern word
        of the same spelling.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus based his whole system of knowledge upon
        belief in the atom as the ultimate existence and from this he deduced
        the mortality of the soul as being by nature a subtle atomic compound.
        This doctrine gained for itself such wide acceptance that the adjective
        psychic, from psyche, &quot;soul,&quot; became the antonym of spiritual,
        as in the Epistle of Jude, verse 19, where the Revised Standard renders
        it &quot;worldly&quot;: &quot;worldly people, devoid of the
        Spirit.&quot; This rendering possesses merit as a translation and may be
        adequate for the general reader but greater exactitude is possible. Jude
        has really furnished us with a precise definition. The &quot;psychic
        people&quot; are animated only by the mortal soul, psyche, and are
        &quot;devoid of the Spirit&quot; which animates the person who has
        experienced the rebirth and thereby attains to immortality.</p>
        <p align="justify">That Jude had the Epicureans in mind is made clear in
        the preceding verse: &quot;In the last time there will be scoffers,
        following their own ungodly desires.&quot; The mention of ridicule is
        the identifying badge for the sect.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was they who had gained for this concept of the
        soul its currency in the public mind and a brief account of its
        development will be helpful. Plato, against whom Epicurus was in
        rebellion, had taught that the soul is immortal and passed from body to
        body by a series of reincarnations. The retort of Epicurus to this may
        be read in one of his sayings: &quot;We have been born once and we
        cannot be born twice, but to all eternity must be no more.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Plato had also looked upon the soul as imprisoned in
        the body and in consequence invited his disciples to indulge in a
        certain self-pity. The intrepid Epicurus, on the contrary, looked upon
        the soul as an equal partner with the body, as being conceived in the
        womb along with it, born with it, and sharing childhood, adolescence,
        maturity, and senility with it, and dying with it.</p>
        <p align="justify">He thought of life as a reciprocation of function
        between body and soul, each dependent upon the other. His own words may
        be quoted in part: &quot;The soul must be regarded as the chief cause of
        sensation; it would not, however, possess this capacity unless it were,
        so to say, enveloped by the rest of the organism; and the rest of the
        organism, while bestowing this capacity upon the soul, also acquires for
        itself from it a share in such contingent capacity.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The effect of this argument is to place body and soul
        upon a parity. Both are corporeal and depend upon each other for their
        functioning. Thus the contrast between body and soul is diminished and
        this fact is reflected in the language of the New Testament. The new
        contrast is between the flesh and the spirit. The word flesh was a key
        word in the writings of Epicurus long before the times of the New
        Testament. Space for one example may be spared: &quot;The cry of the
        flesh is not to hunger, not to thirst, not to suffer from cold.&quot; It
        is true, of course, that flesh and spirit are contrasted in the Old
        Testament, but to stress the point is to place small change on the
        collection plate; in the New Testament the contrast has become a
        necessity of thought, much more than a vivid figure of speech.</p>
        <p align="justify">Another effect, and the more fruitful of consequence,
        of this parity of soul and body, both being corporeal and mortal, is to
        evoke the meaning that rightly puzzles the translators in the
        interpretation of <i>psychikos</i>. In First Corinthians 2:14 the King
        James Version renders it &quot;natural&quot; and the Revised Standard
        &quot;unspiritual&quot;: &quot;The unspiritual (natural) man does not
        receive the gifts of the Spirit of God.&quot; An example upon which the
        truth hinges still more occurs in the same Epistle, 15:44, where
        &quot;physical&quot; is read by the Revised Standard: &quot;It is sown a
        physical body, it is raised a spiritual body.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">All three of these renderings, &quot;natural,&quot;
        &quot;unspiritual,&quot; and &quot;physical,&quot; not to omit the
        fourth, in Jude 19, &quot;worldly,&quot; are for practical purposes
        commendable but still they are makeshifts. Their deficiency becomes
        manifest in 15:44, where the Revised Standard reads: &quot;If there is a
        physical body, there is also a spiritual body.&quot; This makes sense
        but the sense it conveys is not Paul's. What Paul was saying is this:
        &quot;If there is a body animated by a mortal soul, there is also a body
        animated by an immortal spirit.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The deficiency becomes even glaring in the next
        verse, which reads in the Revised Standard: &quot;The first man Adam
        became a living being; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.&quot;
        If this makes sense, the sense is not self-evident, certainly not to the
        general reader. Paul is accepting the doctrine that the psyche is
        corporeal and mortal; in contrast to this stands the eternal spirit,
        which Christ not only received but along with it the power to bestow it.
        Hence we may suggest: &quot;The first man Adam was created to be
        animated by a mortal soul; the last Adam was born to be animated by a
        life-giving spirit.&quot; This may lack the virtue of brevity but the
        obscure can rarely be stated briefly.</p>
        <p align="justify">The thesis here being expounded by Paul is baffling,
        though less because of difficulty than because of its paradoxical
        character. We have become so thoroughly indoctrinated with belief in the
        immortality of the soul that to think of Paul entertaining a different
        view seems preposterous. Yet this is the truth. He concedes to his Greek
        adversaries the mortality of the soul and then escapes from the
        consequences of his concession by positing two stages in creation,
        typified by the first man Adam and the last Adam: &quot;It is not the
        spiritual that is first but the psychical, and the spiritual
        afterward.&quot; The first stage is that of the <i>psyche,</i> the
        second that of the <i>pneuma</i>. The first did not bring immortality;
        this came by gift of God at the second stage of creation.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus Paul deprived the enemies of the cross of Christ
        of all the logical advantage they had gained in plying the public mind
        for three hundred years with evidences of the corporeality of the soul.
        The arguments of Epicurus had become outdated through the miracle of the
        resurrection of Jesus the Christ. The crucial sentence quoted above may
        be paraphrased: &quot;I am not claiming that the spirit came first in
        order of time but I am telling you that the corporeal soul (psyche) came
        first and the spirit at a later date.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus the logic of the cross achieves victory over the
        logic of the atom.</p>

        </b>
        <p align="justify">As yet, however, we have more to learn about the lore
        of the soul according to Epicurus. There is a second assumption of Paul
        that calls for accounting. In the same context in which Epicurus essays
        to demonstrate the parity of partnership between soul and body he
        insists at some length upon the impossibility of either existing after
        separation from the other. The soul is described as composed of the
        finest and most mobile atoms and must be contained and restrained within
        the body, which functions as a vessel. If the bodily vessel is ruptured,
        then the soul disperses like water when the pitcher is broken at the
        fountain.</p>
        <p align="justify">This particular doctrine was not only notorious; it
        was also longlived and suggested to Dante a unique irony of punishment.
        In the sixth circle of his Inferno the guide exhibited to him a cemetery
        of lidless coffins, in which the godless Epicureans on the day of the
        resurrection were to be imprisoned along with their own souls, because
        they had denied that the soul could exist apart from the body.</p>
        <p align="justify">Let us now turn to Paul. In Second Corinthians 12:2-3

        and he heard things that cannot be
        told.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Why should Paul have interposed that saving clause?
        He repeats it in the next verse verbatim, which testifies to his concern
        over the idea. The answer is not difficult. He is protecting himself in
        advance against the embarrassing questions of the Epicureans, the same
        who demand to know in First Corinthians 15:35: &quot;How are the dead
        raised? With what kind of body do they come?&quot; In this instance they
        would have been bantering him with the question: &quot;When you ascended
        to the third heaven, were you in the body or out of the body?&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul assumes that his readers knew of this doctrine,
        that the soul cannot exist apart from the body. The modern reader must
        habituate himself to accept the assumption of its having been as well
        known in Paul's time as the doctrines of Freud are known today.</p>

        Corruption and Incorruption</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">This famous fifteenth chapter of First Corinthians is
        singular for the fact that in verse 52 the word atom occurs, the sole
        example in the Bible. It is hidden for the English reader in the
        translation, &quot;in a moment,&quot; which is amplified in the words
        &quot;in the twinkling of an eye&quot;; but the Greek reads &quot;in an
        atom,&quot; curiously used by Paul to denote a minimum interval of time,
        though strictly signifying the minimum particle of matter.</p>
        <p align="justify">This seems like a trivial clue but it furnishes a
        precious hint of the identity of the adversaries against whom Paul is
        arguing, that is, the Epicureans, the champions of the atomic theory of
        the constitution of matter. This assumption is confirmed by the
        brandishing of the words corruption and incorruption, upon which the
        writings of Epicurus had conferred a universal vogue in the ancient
        world. Unwittingly Epicurus had prepared the word incorruption for its
        role of denoting a blessed concept in Christian thought. We still pay
        him a backhanded compliment whenever this consoling chapter is read in
        our funeral services.</p>
        <p align="justify">If this thought is somewhat startling, Paul's very
        first step in the argument by which he essays to demonstrate the
        doctrine of immortality may be even more so. The questions posed by the
        unnamed but well-known adversaries are these: &quot;How are the dead
        raised? With what kind of body do they come?&quot; Paul's very first
        appeal is to the authority of Nature, which according to Epicurus
        furnished all the criteria of truth: &quot;You foolish man! What you sow
        does not come to life unless it dies.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In general it may well astonish and enlighten us to
        observe how Paul forgets himself and reverts to his Epicurean youth. It
        seems second nature to him to write in Romans 1:26 and 11:24
        &quot;contrary to nature,&quot; and in Romans 11:21 and 24
        &quot;according to nature.&quot; In this very Epistle to the
        Corinthians, 11:14, he may be found employing the expression, &quot;Does
        not Nature herself teach you?&quot; Was it not Epicurus who regarded
        Nature as the supreme teacher? In the Gospels, on the contrary, not a
        single occurrence of this word nature may be found, not even in that of
        Luke, Paul's constant companion.</p>
        <p align="justify">Moreover, when Paul resorts to the comparison between
        the death of the seed and the death of the body, he is not only
        appealing to Nature as a norm of truth; he is also drawing a parallel
        between a natural phenomenon and an event of the spiritual life. This is
        reasoning by analogy, a method much favored by Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">It will be both interesting and rewarding to take the
        next item of argument and observe Paul making himself &quot;as a Greek
        to the Greeks,&quot; verse 39: &quot;For not all flesh is alike, but
        there is one kind for men, another for animals, another for birds, and
        another for fish.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This ground had been thoroughly gone over by Epicurus
        in demonstrating the prevalence of natural law in the physical world as
        opposed to divine creationism. In his view of things the sole creatrix
        was Nature. She was the aggregate of all natural laws and allowed no
        room for miracles. Cats were never born of rabbits nor were rabbits born
        of cats. Each species of animal was governed by the laws that applied to
        it. Moreover, each species had its own habitat: fish were not found in
        treetops nor antlered stags in the depth of the sea.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul adopts this line of reasoning with suitable but
        slight variations and extends it to celestial bodies: &quot;There is one
        glory of the sun, another glory of the moon,&quot; and so on. This
        extension is poetical and has the desired effect of conferring a certain
        sublimity upon the passage. It may have captured the imagination of the
        contemporary reader, and, if so, the success of it would have depended
        upon the adroit transition from the familiar to the unfamiliar.</p>
        <p align="justify">The next step in the reasoning, artfully postponed by
        the little interlude of the sublime and poetical, presents itself in
        verse 44: &quot;If there is a psychical body, there is also a spiritual
        body.&quot; This too is an adroit extension of the familiar to the
        unfamiliar, and when we say familiar, we mean familiar to the literate
        man of Paul's day, because it is no longer familiar to us, however
        learned. It calls for elucidation.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was by this identical reasoning that Epicurus
        strove to demonstrate the existence of the incorruptible. His argument
        may be expressed in the very same shape of sentence: &quot;If there is a
        corruptible body, there must also be an incorruptible body.&quot; The
        procedure is known as arguing from the nature of the visible to the
        nature of the invisible, of which Paul elsewhere reveals his knowledge
        by employing the same terminology as Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this particular instance the reasoning may be
        expanded as follows. In certain of the Authorized Doctrines the
        principle was stated that the universe is infinite in extent. This
        principle, Epicurus assumed, must apply to values no less than to matter
        and space. In other words, if imperfection prevailed throughout the
        whole universe, the universe would not be infinite. Now, in this world
        which we inhabit he believed it a mere matter of observation &quot;that
        the forces of destruction always prevail over the forces of
        creation.&quot; Consequently, he deduced the inference that somewhere
        else there must be a region where &quot;the forces of preservation
        always prevail over the forces of destruction.&quot; This region he
        identified as &quot;the spaces between the worlds,&quot; because he
        assumed that in an infinite universe there must be numberless worlds
        more or less like our own.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the domain of organic life he assumed the
        existence of an ascending scale of creation, of which, in worlds like
        our own, mankind was the peak and crown. Human beings, however, by the
        misfortune of living in a world where the forces of destruction always
        prevail in the end over the forces of creation, were doomed to
        mortality. In other words, their bodies were corruptible. Only in the
        regions between the worlds could incorruptible beings exist and these
        were, of course, the gods.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of this reasoning Paul assumes the validity. He
        merely extends it with the needful modifications of terminology. There
        are two regions, just as in the universe of Epicurus, earth and heaven.
        There are two kinds of beings also, the corruptible and the
        incorruptible, but the incorruptible has a new name: it is the
        spiritual. Paul even accepts, as shown in the previous section, the
        doctrine of Epicurus that the soul of man, psyche, is corporeal and
        mortal.</p>
        <p align="justify">While adducing proof of the existence of the
        spiritual body, according to a logic familiar to his readers, Paul is at
        no pains to describe it and this fact may be significant; it seems to
        have been an assumption too general to require mention that divinity was
        associated with light. In Philippians 3:20-21 he writes: &quot;who will
        change our lowly body to be like his glorious body.&quot; Our
        information about the Epicurean heavens and the incorruptible gods is
        not abundant but we do know that the bodies of these gods were
        translucent and their abode was one of perpetual light. Paul seems
        consequently to be assuring his converts that after the miracle of the
        resurrection it would be their portion to enjoy for ever and ever the
        same sort of existence which Epicureans believed to be reserved for
        their blissful and incorruptible gods.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        The Last Enemy</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">In verse 26 Paul writes: &quot;The last enemy to be
        destroyed is death.&quot; The view of Epicurus was not dissimilar. From
        the pen of Metrodorus, who was often empowered by the master to speak
        for the sect, we have these words: &quot;Against all else it is possible
        to establish security, but as for death, so far as concerns it, all of
        us human beings inhabit a city without walls.&quot; The most arduous of
        tasks for the resolute and dauntless Epicurus was to liberate man from
        the fear of death and reconcile him to mortality.</p>
        <p align="justify">The gist of his conclusion is embodied in the second
        of his Authorized Doctrines, one of the most publicized sayings in all
        ancient thought: &quot;Death is nothing to us, because dissolution is
        the loss of consciousness and unconsciousness is nothing to us.&quot; We
        also possess an exhortation of his which enlarges somewhat upon this
        sentiment: &quot;Habituate yourself to the thought that death is nothing
        to us, because all good and evil lie in consciousness and death is the
        loss of consciousness. Consequently a right understanding of the fact
        that death means nothing to us renders enjoyable the mortality of life,
        not by the addition of infinite time but by taking away the yearning for
        immortality. For there is nothing to fear in living for the man who has
        thoroughly grasped the idea that there is nothing to fear in not
        living.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In pursuance of this arduous task of subduing the
        last enemy the diligent Epicurus also analyzed with his customary acumen
        the feelings of the worldly man in anticipation of death. These he found
        to be three: ingratitude, self-pity, and fear. Ingratitude for past
        blessings inclines the man to shrink from death as the end of all
        pleasure. Self-pity leads him to dwell in his mind upon mortality, the
        funeral pyre, and the chill and damp of the tomb. The consciousness of
        wrongdoing causes him to be haunted by fear of punishment after death.</p>
        <p align="justify">All of these miseries are ascribable to what Epicurus
        called &quot;false opinions&quot; and these can be cured by right
        reason. The whole experience of man, according to Epicurus, can be
        controlled and must be kept in control. For example, the fear of
        punishment after death can be dispelled by the knowledge that the gods
        are incapable of anger and indifferent to the affairs of mankind.
        Self-pity in the face of death can be cured by the knowledge that death
        is sheer unconsciousness. The misery of ingratitude can be forestalled
        by diligent cultivation of the memory of past blessings.</p>
        <p align="justify">Even after this diligent reasoning there was
        something lacking, some counterpoise needed for the surrender of
        immortality. This is furnished in an Authorized Doctrine, which reads:
        &quot;Infinite time and finite time are characterized by equal pleasure
        if one measures the limitations of pleasure by reason.&quot; This means
        that the pleasures of life have a limit and, if the individual has so
        planned his life as to have enjoyed the fullness of pleasure, which is
        the fullness of happiness, he cannot exceed this limit in eternal life.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Victory over Death</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus in another Authorized Doctrine insists that
        it is the flesh that finds the limits of pleasure boundless and yearns
        for eternal life, which may remind us of Paul's dictum in Galatians
        5:17: &quot;For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the
        desires of the Spirit are against the flesh.&quot; In the reasoning of
        Epicurus, however, the antithesis is between the flesh and the mind or
        intellect. The individual who has soberly reasoned the problem out
        reflects that he has enjoyed the fullness of pleasure in this life and
        fearlessly faces death. He has achieved what to Paul is victory over
        death.</p>
        <p align="justify">The consequence is that the good Epicurean takes
        leave of life with a cry of triumph. This is the case with the old man
        of Oenoanda, who caused the doctrines of Epicurus to be inscribed on
        stone in the market place of his native town, not far from Colossae. We
        possess a similar record from the pen of Metrodorus, known as a second
        Epicurus: &quot;When necessity calls upon us to depart, spitting lustily
        upon life and upon those who madly cling to it, we shall take our leave
        of living with a glorious paean of victory, hymning the refrain that we
        have lived the good life.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Since this refrain was widely known, it is no
        accident that Paul, who has been expounding the new doctrine of
        immortality with a steadily rising elevation of thought, should crown
        this exposition with his own paean of victory: &quot;Death is swallowed
        up in victory,&quot; and &quot;O death, where is thy sting? O grave,
        where is thy victory?&quot; Paul, however, is a careless citator when he
        quotes the Old Testament and a consultation of the usual references in
        the concordances to Isaiah and Hosea uncovers no mention of the sting of
        death.</p>
        <p align="justify">Luckily we know that this originated with the
        Epicureans, probably with Epicurus himself. At any rate, we find it in
        the concluding passage of the third book of Lucretius, where the
        feelings of the worldly man are analyzed as he contemplates the approach
        of death. It will be rewarding to scrutinize this analysis anew; our
        understanding of the sting may be modified and improved.</p>
        <p align="justify">As it turns out, it is not the sting as of an insect,
        sudden, sharp, and single, as we may have thought. It is rather the
        continuous goading that comes of unhappy thoughts, ingratitude,
        self-pity, and fear of the hereafter. The Greek or Latin word that we
        translate as &quot;sting&quot; means also the goad with which oxen are
        driven to the plow; it was of wood, whittled to a point and applied
        again and again. It was this incessant repetition of the pain and not
        its intensity that the original metaphor was intended to convey.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul amplifies his paean of victory in a single
        sentence: &quot;The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the
        law.&quot; In this the sole word that is alien to Epicureanism is sin;
        in that pagan creed no divine law was recognized and for that reason
        there was no concept of sin. This fact, however, makes little difference
        in the psychology of guilt; the Greek no less than the Jew could be
        goaded by the fear of punishment for the violation of law. Paul is here
        forgetting himself and speaking as an Old Testament Jew or a pagan. Had
        he been speaking as a Christian according to his own structure of
        doctrine, no mention of law would have been needful, because it had been
        superseded. In his new structure of doctrine the cardinal offense had
        become the refusal to recognize the resurrected Christ, and it was not
        sinners but unbelievers who were to be destroyed on the last day.</p>
        <p align="justify">Since Paul is not speaking consistently with himself,
        it should not be surprising that the meaning of his words, &quot;the
        power of sin is the law,&quot; may be readily explained by reference to
        Epicurus, who deals with this idea in two of his Authorized Doctrines.
        In one of these he writes: &quot;Violating the law is not an evil in
        itself but the evil lies in the uneasy feeling, of the nature of fear,
        that he may not escape detection by those appointed for the punishment
        of such offenses.&quot; In the second Doctrine he writes that the
        wrongdoer &quot;cannot have confidence that he will escape detection,
        even if ten thousand times he does escape for the time being, because to
        the day of death it will be uncertain whether to the last he will
        escape.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Having now learned from Epicurus how the law operates
        as the power behind sin or wrongdoing, we are qualified to cast a glance
        of scrutiny at the previous clause, &quot;the sting of death is
        sin.&quot; In this case we may trace both the word and idea to Epicurus.
        According to his analysis of the feelings of the foolish old man at the
        approach of death it is the consciousness of wrongdoing and the fear of
        punishment for the same in the life hereafter that bestows upon death
        its power to goad its prospective victim. It may even be better for the
        sake of precision to revise the translation and read: &quot;The goad of
        death is sin.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If now we attempt the customary backward glance over
        this chapter we should first recall the principle that a positive
        declaration presumes its opposite: &quot;the logic of the cross&quot;
        presumes the existence of the unnamed logic of the atom.</p>
        <p align="justify">Next we should recall that &quot;the logic of the
        cross&quot; achieves its victory over its competitor by the assumption
        of two stages of creation, the one characterized by the corporeal and
        mortal soul, psyche, the other characterized by the immortal spirit. The
        concept of immortality that Epicurus derided has become outdated; a new
        concept of immortality has been launched, to which the old arguments
        will not apply.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of less importance, though helpful in any
        understanding of Paul's mind and its working, is his conformance with
        the Epicurean practice of concluding with a paean of victory over death.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lastly, we have found Paul throughout his argument
        adopting the procedures of his competitor, even to the extent of
        appealing to Nature as a source of truth and incorporating Epicurean
        ideas in his paean of victory. This phenomenon was destined to repeat
        itself. The African churchmen Arnobius and Lactantius create the
        impression in the minds of informed readers of knowing their
        Epicureanism at least as well as their Bibles.

        the leprosy of Naaman the Syrian without touch or even presence there
        was no mention of faith.</p>
        <p align="justify">When the Roman centurion begged for the healing of
        his servant in a similar way, Jesus exclaimed: &quot;Truly, I say to
        you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If the word <i>faith</i> were proportionately as
        frequent in the Old Testament as in the New, there would be some seven
        hundred occurrences. Actually there is one example.</p>
        <p align="justify">This astonishing emergence of the word <i>faith</i>
        is but one outstanding feature of the revolution of thought that took
        place in the interval between the Old and the New Testaments.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this study the assumption is made that this
        revolution was in the main a consequence of the impact of Greek
        skepticism upon Jewish culture and in particular of the scientific
        materialism of Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">The instinctive reaction of orthodox Judaism to
        Epicureanism was total rejection; the very name of Epicurus in the form
        of <i>apikoro</i> was adopted into the Hebrew tongue as a synonym for
        unbeliever. Jewish students were exhorted &quot;to master Torah so as to
        be able to answer the Epicurean.&quot; This reaction is comparable to
        the revulsion of modern fundamentalism from the theory of biological
        evolution.</p>
        <p align="justify">The reaction of Jesus and Paul to Epicureanism was
        complex and contradictory. By their time, total rejection had become
        unimaginable, because the busy Greeks had explored the whole domain of
        ethics with a mathematical thoroughness unknown to the authors of Psalms
        and Proverbs; and their findings were available in brief and
        well-written textbooks that were adapted to catch the interest of
        literate and intelligent people everywhere. The pious Jew would have
        memorized much sage advice about anger, as in Psalm 37:8: &quot;Cease
        from anger and forsake wrath&quot;; his Greek friend, however, would
        give him a booklet of Philodemus to read, with the title <i>On Anger</i>,
        in which the reactions of all classes of men to this disturbing emotion
        were systematically analyzed. This booklet is still extant in fragments.</p>
        <p align="justify">Again, in the Old Testament there is an abundance of
        warnings against the deceitfulness of riches, as in Proverbs 11:28
        &quot;He that trusteth in his riches shall fall.&quot; The friendly
        Greek, however, would pass on to his Jewish neighbor for reading a
        systematic treatise entitled <i>On Wealth</i> from the pen of
        Metrodorus, in which the reactions of poverty and riches upon the
        happiness of the individual were systematically studied. This book is
        lost to us, but Epicurus had written on the same subject and an excerpt
        that survives may be quoted as a specimen: &quot;Poverty, if measured by
        the end of Nature, is great wealth but unlimited wealth is great
        poverty.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In truth, if we survey the whole body of Epicurean
        writings on ethics, we may appraise it as a veritable supplement to the
        best elements of the Wisdom Literature of the Jews. It campaigned, in
        particular, against the deceitfulness of wealth, glory, and power, which
        reflects itself abundantly in the Gospels.</p>
        <p align="justify">Over against this extensive agreement in practical
        morality, which was at times extremely embarrassing, stood a total
        opposition in respect of theology and the motivation of conduct.
        Epicurus denied all interest or participation on the part of the gods in
        the affairs of this world. Long before the time of Jesus he had been
        ridiculing prophecy and miracles. His disciples in Thessalonica
        ridiculed the prediction by Paul of the second coming of Christ. In
        Athens they &quot;mocked&quot; at the mention of the resurrection of the
        dead. This persistent campaign of mockery is reflected by the vehemence
        with which Jesus asserted the fatherhood of God and by the persistence
        with which Paul preached the doctrine of grace.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is in such a clash and tension of creed against
        creed that new doctrines are born, that virtues previously unhonored are
        exalted to top importance, and that ideas once commonplace acquire the
        status of blessed concepts. So long as miracles were accepted as being
        within the order of things, as in the time of Elisha, there was no need
        even to make mention of faith. When once, however, the belief in
        miracles became the target of deliberate mockery, as was the practice of
        the Epicureans, then faith was speedily exalted to the rank of a virtue.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet to this general statement a momentous addition
        must be made. Miracles of healing were no novelty to the Greeks; to this
        day they are documented in inscriptions on stone from the shrine of
        Asclepius, patron god of physicians, at Epidaurus in Greece. The
        resurrection of the dead, on the contrary, and in particular a universal
        resurrection of the dead, was a supermiracle, the miracle of miracles.
        To believe in this required a faith exceeding all previous demands upon
        faith. Thus mockery became all the more vigorous<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        such a faith was
        foolishness to the Greeks<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>–</span>
        and, as the vigor of mockery increased, all
        the more emphasis was bound to be placed upon the virtue of faith.</p>
        <p align="justify">If doubt should exist that the Epicureans were
        ridiculing the Jews for their belief in miracles, this may perhaps be
        dispelled by a singular item of evidence from ancient Italy, and that
        too at a date close to the birth of Christ.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the year 37 B.C. a meeting was arranged between
        Mark Antony and the younger Caesar to take place at Tarentum for the
        purpose of dividing the government between them. Antony's party was
        coming from the East by sea, Caesar's supporters by land from Rome.
        While one group of the latter paused at a small town near the modern
        Bari, the priests of a local shrine undertook to stage a miracle for
        their diversion; the incense on the altar was to ignite without the
        application of flame. This was the signal, as the Roman poet Horace
        relates it, for a round of laughter and witticisms. &quot;Let the Jew
        Apella believe it,&quot; he adds, &quot;not I.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Indeed it might almost appear that the poet had
        knowledge of the miracle invoked by the prayer of Elias in First Kings
        18:38, where it reads: &quot;The fire of the Lord fell and consumed the
        burnt sacrifice.&quot; At any rate, he wrote: &quot;For I have learned
        the lesson that the gods pass a life untroubled by concern and, if
        Nature does perform some wonder, it is no frowning gods that send it
        down from their lofty mansion in the sky.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In expressing this sentiment he was quoting almost
        verbatim the Epicurean poet Lucretius, who had died only a few years
        before. It may be added that Horace's own outlook on life was largely
        Epicurean and at the time of the incident he was in Epicurean company.</p>
        <p align="justify">From this story the inference may be drawn that if in
        distant Italy before the birth of Christ the Jews were being ridiculed
        for their belief in miracles, how much more would this have been true in
        Palestine, where Epicureanism had been flourishing for at least two
        centuries, and must have been flourishing all the more as numerous Greek
        cities were being founded or refounded across the Jordan River in the
        very century of the nativity.</p>

        Structures of Thought</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">In order to understand the clash between Epicureanism
        and Christianity it must be recognized first of all that a philosopher,
        such as Epicurus, organizes his thought into what may be called a
        conceptual scheme. At any rate, the logician would so describe it. By
        the semanticist the same scheme would be styled a structure of meanings
        or a matrix of meanings. Whatever it be called, however, the concepts
        that are built into the scheme are arranged around some central concept
        as the parts of the atom are arranged around the nucleus. Each concept
        takes its meaning from its part in the scheme.</p>
        <p align="justify">This abstract statement may be transferred from the
        realm of philosophy or semantics to that of common knowledge by
        recounting what Epicurus had to say about faith, which was considerable.
        In his thinking, the central or nuclear concept was called
        &quot;ataraxy,&quot; which means the peace of mind that comes of freedom
        from all disturbing thoughts. In order to enjoy this peace the
        individual must be free from fear of fate, from fear of Fortune, from
        fear of divine wrath, and from fear of death and the hereafter. In order
        to be free from these fears, in turn, man must have faith in the truth
        of doctrine. To furnish the foundations of faith Epicurus composed
        numerous handbooks and in particular he drew up his list of forty
        Authorized Doctrines, which were an anticipation of Articles of Faith in
        the later Christian church.</p>
        <p align="justify">A few particulars will further clarify the meaning of
        the above. According to Greek myths it was the destiny of Achilles to
        die by a wound in his heel and of Oedipus to slay his own father and
        marry his own mother. These are examples of fate. All such stories were
        dismissed as silliness by Epicurus. He adduced reasoned proofs that the
        gods lived aloof from the world and the affairs of mankind.</p>
        <p align="justify">The physical world, he undertook to prove, was
        governed by natural laws but even in this doctrine there was something
        to fear. Certain Greek philosophers had already anticipated certain
        modern scientists by putting forward a mechanistic theory of the
        universe, according to which the behavior of the individual was
        absolutely predetermined by physical laws. Epicurus revolted from this
        more violently than from divine decrees. To escape from this crippling
        mechanistic necessity he postulated a sufficient degree of play in the
        motions of the atoms to permit of free will in man. Thus, according to
        his thinking, in spite of the fact that the physical universe was
        governed solely by natural laws, man himself could claim exemption from
        these laws.</p>
        <p align="justify">As for Fortune, whom Greeks and Romans revered as a
        goddess, the bringer of wealth and poverty, freedom and slavery, all
        fear of her pranks could be forestalled by foresight and preparedness.</p>
        <p align="justify">Fear of death was nullified by knowledge of the
        nature of man. The soul was a volatile compound of atoms and subject to
        dissolution; dissolution, in turn, resulted in unconsciousness and
        unconsciousness was not to be feared. By the same knowledge fear of the
        hereafter was canceled. Faith in this knowledge would assure peace of
        mind.</p>
        <p align="justify">On the social level the enjoyment of peace of mind
        was dependent upon the feeling of safety or security, which is a sort of
        faith. According to Epicurus, this could be assured by systematically
        cultivating friendships, upon which the individual could count for aid
        in all the emergencies against which the modern man seeks protection by
        various forms of paid insurance, by sick benefits, unemployment relief,
        and pensions. The fact that confident dependence upon this source of aid
        was recognized by Epicurus as being a form of faith is made manifest by
        one of his sayings, which is made the more memorable by the play upon
        words: &quot;We do not so much need help in time of need as faith in
        help in time of need.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">According to his reasoning the chief enemy of peace
        of mind is uncertainty, the opposite of faith. He thought it worse, for
        example, to be uncertain whether to believe in judgment after death than
        either to believe in it or disbelieve it. Again, he thought the reason
        that crime does not pay is the very uncertainty of punishment. If this
        seems a negative sort of teaching the positive aspect of it is also
        clearly expressed in Authorized Doctrine 17: &quot;The just life knows
        the most perfect peace but the unjust life is burdened to the limit with
        worry.&quot; This line of reasoning may suggest to us the words of Paul
        in Romans 1:17, &quot;The just shall live by faith,&quot; and also throw
        some light upon it.</p>
        <p align="justify">If a synoptic glance be now cast over all these items
        of truth concerning faith, it may be seen how they go together to
        constitute a conceptual scheme, a structure of thought, or a matrix of
        meanings. The nuclear concept according to Epicurus is ataraxy or peace
        of mind. Around this may be ranged a galaxy of positive and negative
        concepts. The negatives are fears: fear of poverty and calamity, fear of
        fate, fear of vengeful gods, fear of death, and fear of judgment and
        punishment hereafter. The positive concepts are aspects of faith: faith
        in friends, faith in the just life, faith in doctrine concerning the
        gods, death, and judgment.</p>
        <p align="justify">Out of this structure of thought there emerges, it
        must be discerned, a genuine value in matters of conduct, the virtue of
        faith. Faith is already well on its way to becoming a blessed concept
        and the word faith is well on its way to becoming one of those
        electrified symbols of thought which are capable of relaying a surge of
        spiritual feeling never contemplated by Epicurus himself, in spite of
        the fact that he took the first steps in preparing it to perform this
        function.</p>
        <p align="justify">The ethical validity of the truth so erected was too
        genuine to be rejected by Christianity but the implied theology was too
        repellent to be tolerated. This repulsion had the effect of throwing
        Christianity to the opposite extreme, so that, while appropriating the
        concept of faith, it joined it with miracles, which Epicurus had
        ridiculed; it joined it with the fatherhood of God and divine
        providence, concepts which to Epicurus were incompatible with deity. The
        very vehemence with which Jesus preached these reconstituted concepts is
        silent testimony to the vigor of the impact exercised upon Judaism in
        the interval between the Old Testament and the New. In the Old Testament
        they were mere assumptions; it was the persistent and organized campaign
        of assault upon them that created a compelling necessity of building
        them up into an explicit and positive structure of thought.</p>
        <p align="justify">Naturally this process of erecting the new structure
        of thought was only the concluding phase of a slow and gradual movement
        extending over a long period of time. If such movements be graphically
        charted they take the form of a slowly ascending line, which toward the
        end begins to rise at a sharper angle until a maximum height is reached.
        The speed of the change follows a similar law; extremely slow in its
        first stages, it also accelerates slowly but toward the end begins to
        accelerate more rapidly until at last the phenomenon ends explosively.</p>
        <p align="justify">If now an attempt be made to fit the history of the
        idea of faith into this pattern, the outcome will be as follows. Of that
        extended period of time during which the movement was very slowly
        gathering altitude and speed, we have an imperfect record; it transpired
        in the two centuries between the Old and New Testaments. All that we
        possess in the record is the social and religious revolution with which
        it terminated. This is recorded for us in the stories of Jesus and Paul.
        At the beginning faith was an assumption; at the end faith had become a
        doctrine. The idea of faith has been elevated to the rank of a blessed
        concept and the term faith had been enrolled in the chorus of blessed
        words.</p>
        <p align="justify">Even in our scant records there are two phases in the
        history of the idea and both of them are somewhat explosive, even if
        today this hardly seems to be true. Jesus took pains to give the
        impression that he had come not to destroy, but to fulfill. It was not
        an innovation when he demanded belief in the fatherhood of God and his
        providence; this was implied in the old religion; all that was new was
        the demand for a fresh emphasis and a fresh vitality of belief. When, on
        the other hand, he demanded faith in himself, which he did constantly,
        this was revolutionary and the end result of this demand was the
        crucifixion.</p>
        <p align="justify">The second and final phase of the history of the idea<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>–</span>
        and the more revolutionary<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>–</span>
        was an inevitable sequel of the
        previous phase. What Paul demanded was faith in the resurrection of
        Christ as an event historically authenticated. The reality of this event
        was construed by him as the guarantee of the second coming, the general
        resurrection, and the exaltation of believers. It should hardly be
        needful to quote First Corinthians 15:14 &quot;And if Christ be not
        risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith also is vain.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The assent to belief in the resurrection of Christ as
        an historical event is the act of faith with which the religious
        experience begins; this experience proceeds, as described in Romans 1:
        1, &quot;from faith to faith&quot;; it finds its fruition in the state
        of perfect faith that is &quot;the peace of God.&quot; Thus, as we may
        read in Hebrews 12:2, Jesus is &quot;the author and finisher of our
        faith,&quot; though it would be more precise to read, &quot;the beginner
        and the finisher.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">On this topic there is still a note to be added.
        Although Epicurus has been denied much influence upon the growth of
        religion, the atomic theory of matter, which he espoused, was making a
        smart impact on the study of medicine. It was an atomist, for instance,
        if not certainly an Epicurean, Erasistratus by name, who first traced
        the trunk nerves to the brain. It also fell to his lot to give an
        impulse to the movement that exalted the spirit of man as opposed to the
        soul, which we can discern in operation in Paul's thinking. The tendency
        had long flourished of associating the breath of life with the air of
        the atmosphere but men knew they must be different. This Erasistratus
        thought to solve the puzzle by proposing that the air was transformed in
        the heart into the vital breath. This was merely one facet of a drift of
        thought that presented many aspects. It contributed to the vogue of the
        word spirit, Latin spiritus, &quot;breath,&quot; without which little
        thinking could be done in the realm of religion.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Hope</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The emergence of hope as a virtue exhibits a pattern
        similar to that of faith but with a surprising difference. In this
        instance the significant contrast is not between the Old and the New
        Testament but rather between the Gospels on the one hand and Acts and
        the Epistles on the other. The noun hope is not found in the Gospels.
        Jesus had little to say about the life hereafter and nothing about the
        hope of it. The determining factor in his thinking is an event in the
        present: &quot;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&quot; His teachings
        constitute a gospel of the present and not of the future; his mind is
        preoccupied by the urgency of the present and not of the future; the
        immediate demand is for repentance and belief, which raises
        procrastination to the rank of a cardinal sin. Hope is virtually
        forgotten.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the processes of Paul's thought, on the contrary,
        the determining factors are two: first, the belief in an event in the
        past, the resurrection of Christ; and second, the expectation of an
        event in the future, the second coming and the general resurrection.
        These two events are complementary to each other and the faith in the
        one is correlative to the hope of the other. Thus faith and hope become
        an inseparable pair.</p>
        <p align="justify">Next, as will be shown with more explicitness in the
        following chapter, faith and hope are virtues of the interim of time
        between the two resurrections and their validity will terminate with the
        event that terminates the interim, the second coming, which will justify
        the faith and fulfill the hope. For this reason in First Corinthians
        13:13 these two are made to rank lower than love, which is of the nature
        of God himself and eternal. This beloved verse, however, must be
        translated anew in order to make this interpretation clear. This
        correction will be made in due course.</p>
        <p align="justify">It follows from all this that the gospel of Paul is
        essentially one of hope, while that of Jesus is one of repentance. The
        words <i>repent</i> and <i>repentance</i> abound in the first three
        Gospels, while confined in Paul's writings to some seven examples.
        Contrarily, the verb <i>hope</i> is lacking in Matthew and Mark and
        confined to three examples in Luke and one in John, though abounding in
        the Pauline writings.</p>
        <p align="justify">For Paul, therefore, there are two classes of men:
        those who have hope and &quot;the others who have no hope,&quot; as we
        read in First Thessalonians 4:13. In the class of men without hope the
        Epicureans were the more conspicuous because they ridiculed all prophecy
        and in particular the prophecy of the second coming and the general
        resurrection, which provokes Paul in this same Epistle, 5:3, to express
        his scorn for them, identifying them by their watchwords Peace and
        Safety.</p>
        <p align="justify">This identification should meet with the readier
        acceptance for the reason that the Stoics had already denounced their
        more popular rivals as men without hope on the ground of their
        repudiating divine providence. We learn this from the Stoic philosopher
        Seneca, who makes it plain that men who reject belief in divine
        providence can have no hope of benefiting by the goodness of the divine
        being. Thus it becomes manifest that this characterization of the
        Epicureans was already part of the public mind of the time and Paul was
        merely confirming it on novel and more specific grounds.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        The Epicurean Hope</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus, however, had captured the attention of the
        public mind long before the days of Jesus and Paul and in some essential
        respects had prefigured the teachings of both. He had the precedence
        over Jesus, for example, in stamping with emphasis the urgency of the
        present and in making a cardinal sin of procrastination, but this topic
        cannot be amplified here. What immediately demands our attention is his
        precedence over Paul in winning a status of blessedness for the concept
        of hope. Over the space of three centuries his teachings had been making
        the ancient public familiar with a philosophy of hope and either
        fortuitously or providentially preparing the way for the acceptance of a
        religion of hope.</p>
        <p align="justify">As was characteristic of all the reasonings of
        Epicurus, this particular teaching was offered in a neat and attractive
        package. It presumed for mankind the possession of free will and taught
        the possibility and necessity of keeping the whole experience of the
        individual under control. To this end the individual must deliberately
        choose his attitude toward the past, the present, and the future. The
        proper attitude toward the past was judged to be gratitude; toward the
        present, the will to enjoy it to the full; and toward the future, hope.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is possible to be more specific: by gratitude
        toward the past is meant the grateful recollection of past pleasures; by
        hope of the future is meant the happy expectation of pleasures to come.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus the virtues of gratitude and hope are
        complementary to each other and this may well remind us that in Paul's
        scheme of thought faith and hope are complementary concepts, because
        faith signifies belief in an event of the past, the resurrection of
        Christ, and hope signifies belief in an event of the future, the second
        coming.</p>
        <p align="justify">The substitution of faith, however, as a concept
        reciprocal to hope, has a curious consequence. The virtue of gratitude
        is deprived of a context and is left in isolation. Its validity as a
        factor of conduct, however, cannot be denied -- and in numerous passages
        Paul urges the giving of thanks -- but the giving of thanks becomes a
        duty of the individual toward God, as in Second Corintlhians 9:15
        &quot;Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!&quot; With Epicurus the
        attitude of thankfulness is to be cultivated because ingratitude spells
        misery, especially in old age.</p>
        <p align="justify">A similar observation may be made concerning hope as
        a factor of conduct. With Epicurus the virtue of hope is esteemed as a
        factor of happiness. Pessimistic people are not only unhappy themselves;
        they also contribute to the unhappiness of others. It is for this reason
        that an attitude of hopefulness should be adopted and cultivated. Of
        this Paul shows himself aware in his ecstatic hymn of love, First
        Corinthians 13; in verse 7 we read: &quot;Love hopeth all things.&quot;
        As will be shown in the next chapter, this verse deals with human
        relations and this particular clause means that the individual who feels
        true brotherly love is hopeful under all circumstances and never
        pessimistic. Thus hope means two things to Paul: first, it is a virtue
        of conduct day by day; and second, it is the hope of the second coming
        and its glorious sequels.</p>

        Hope and Health</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">This account of the virtue of hope would be left
        one-sided and deficient were we to omit mention of the association of
        hope with health in the creed of Epicurus. The bearing of this
        association upon Paul's attitudes and reasonings may not be obvious at
        the outset but this bearing can be demonstrated and the reward will be
        an improved understanding of the content and workings of Paul's mind.</p>
        <p align="justify">It will be well to begin with certain words of
        Epicurus himself. One of his most quoted sayings runs as follows:
        &quot;The stable condition of sound health in the flesh and the
        confident hope of this means the height of pleasure and the best
        assurance of it for those who are able to figure the problem out.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">By this time it should not be necessary for us to
        amplify at length the figuring of the problem. A brief chain argument
        will suffice: if belief in an afterlife is denied, this mortal life
        becomes the most precious possession of man; by the same token health
        becomes equally precious, and the hope of its continuance becomes the
        greatest of pleasures.</p>
        <p align="justify">Enemies of Epicurus, and especially the Platonists,
        retorted that the hope of continuous health was one of the most illusory
        things in life and they quoted the great physician Hippocrates in
        support of their thesis. The disciples of Epicurus, nevertheless,
        continued to follow the master and placed their reliance upon the simple
        life as the assurance of health.</p>
        <p align="justify">Welcome corroboration of this teaching was afforded
        by new tendencies in the practice of medicine, because the atomic theory
        as espoused by Epicurus had begun from an early date to exert a definite
        influence upon the art of healing. For example, the renowned medical
        researcher Erasistratus, who was an atomist, if not certainly an
        Epicurean, began to lay unprecedented stress upon what we now call
        therapeutics in the treatment of disease and specifically upon diet and
        exercise.</p>
        <p align="justify">These tendencies were manifested also in the
        activities of Asclepiades, undoubtedly an Epicurean, who lived in Rome,
        knew the great men of the day, such as Cicero, and became the
        outstanding physician of the ancient world in the last century B.C. His
        fame was the greater because he possessed the art of dramatizing himself
        and on one occasion stopped a funeral procession and revived the corpse.
        His achievements were nevertheless substantial: he was the first to
        distinguish clearly between acute and chronic phases of disease and his
        influence was long-lasting and beneficent in the domain of medical
        services in the Roman army.</p>
        <p align="justify">The particular aspect of his innovations that here
        concerns us was his rebellion against the callousness of physicians and
        his sympathetic consideration for the feelings and comfort of the
        patient.</p>
        <p align="justify">A brief anecdote will at one and the same time serve
        to exemplify the callousness that was in vogue and remind us usefully of
        the close association between philosophers and physicians. On a certain
        occasion the philosopher Antisthenes, from whom the more robust breed of
        Stoics was said to trace its lineage, was asked why he &quot;lashed out
        so savagely at his pupils.&quot; &quot;Because,&quot; he replied,
        &quot;physicians do the same with the sick.&quot; This Antisthenes, by
        the way, maintained that pain was a good thing and was continually
        saying, &quot;I would rather go mad than feel pleasure.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus both philosophers and physicians were divided
        two ways according to their attitudes toward pleasure and pain.</p>
        <p align="justify">One of the innovations of the sympathetic Epicurean
        physicians was to allow patients the use of wine, and the very fact of
        this having found a place in the records should remind us how shocking
        it must have been to old practitioners. Having knowledge of the
        innovation, however, we may read with more interest and understanding
        the advice of Paul in First Timothy 5:23 &quot;Do not confine yourself
        to water any longer but use a little wine because of your throat and
        your frequent attacks of illness.&quot; The word that we inherit as <i>stomach</i>
        means &quot;throat&quot; in good Greek and it seems that Timothy may
        have suffered from a recurrent trouble in his throat. It is very
        doubtful that Paul was advising him to use a little wine &quot;for his
        stomach's sake.&quot; He was rather telling him that his malady required
        no departure from his regular diet.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul, like Epicurus himself and the Epicurean
        physicians, was interested in the subject of diet and his views were
        liberal, as we may learn from Philippians 4:12, where our accepted
        versions tend to be evasive. We should rather read: &quot;I know how to
        eat my fill and how to go hungry.&quot; On the teachings of the rival
        schools about such questions Paul may have learned much from Luke. The
        very description of this man as &quot;the beloved physician&quot; ought
        to be sufficient evidence that he was no sponsor of pain as something
        good. He was notably a sympathetic man, especially toward women, as may
        be observed in his Gospel, and this particular trait was traditional
        with Epicureans, who from the first admitted women to the study of their
        philosophy, while other schools tolerated only the few viragos who
        possessed the hardihood to force their way in.</p>
        <p align="justify">If now we make the customary pause for taking our
        bearings afresh, it will be enlightening to observe the similarity
        between the Epicurean attitude toward health and the hope of its
        continuance with a thriving and growing attitude in modern society.
        Never before in all history have such concerted efforts been made toward
        improving and preserving public health and increasing the comfort and
        security of old age and the hope of it. It is true that we are not yet
        stamping the word Security upon our coins, as the Romans in Paul's day
        were stamping their SECURITAS, but the word security is already far on
        its way toward becoming a blessed concept, just as peace and safety were
        blessed concepts to the Epicureans.</p>
        <p align="justify">In respect of this ancient movement in philosophy and
        medicine Paul was, as usual, pulled two ways, one way by the ethic of
        the thing and the other way by the logic and motivation of it. He was
        able to feel in total sympathy with the increased consideration for the
        health and comfort of mankind but was utterly unable to concede to the
        hope of health and a happy old age the first place in the expectation of
        mankind.</p>
        <p align="justify">To Epicurus, who rejected immortality, the supreme
        joy might be the possession of health and the confident hope of its
        continuance; but for Paul, who looked forward to eternal life, the
        keenest emotion was &quot;the joy of the faith,&quot; as in Philippians
        1:25 or &quot;joy in the Holy Spirit,&quot; as in Romans 14:17.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the respective contexts Epicurus and Paul employ
        the same Greek word chara. To the one it signified the joy that comes of
        fullness of life in the flesh and the hope of it; to the other it
        signified the joy that comes of fullness of life in the Spirit and the
        hope of it. A philosophy of hope was stimulating the growth of a
        religion of hope.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        The Love of God</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus thought of himself as a pathfinder in the
        exploration of truth, blazing a way for others who might choose to
        follow in his footsteps. It was not permissible for Paul as a humble
        servant of God to lay claim to such a distinction for himself, but the
        very diligence with which he cultivated humility is evidence of his
        consciousness of faring through strange seas of thought alone.</p>
        <p align="justify">There is this further similarity between the two men,
        at least for those who appreciate a little subtlety of thought. Epicurus
        in his eager desire to dethrone the Platonic reason and exalt Nature and
        science as the source of truth, involuntarily placed himself in the
        paradoxical position of employing reason to dethrone reason. In like
        manner Paul, because of his eager determination to supersede the
        philosophy of love by the religion of love, was placing himself in the
        paradoxical position of reasoning after the fashion of the philosopher
        to overthrow the philosophy itself.</p>
        <p align="justify">The chief obstacle to our discerning aright the drift
        of Paul's reasoning arises from our very familiarity with his writings.
        A particular difficulty arises from the necessity of discerning the
        unfamiliar negatives that underlie his too familiar positives.</p>
        <p align="justify">We shall make no mistake, however, if we select as a
        point of departure his belief in the resurrection of Christ as
        historical fact. From this beginning a whole chain of argument will lead
        us aright. This resurrection would not have occurred but for the
        ministry and crucifixion of Jesus as historically recorded. These,
        again, would not have come to pass without the love of Christ for
        mankind. This love, in its turn, would never have existed but for the
        love of God for mankind, of which it was the manifestation.</p>
        <p align="justify">By this chain of reasoning we thus arrive at ultimate
        facts, God and the love of God, beyond which there is no other reality.
        This conclusion once being reached, we may discern the unfamiliar
        negative that was at the back of Paul's mind when he pronounced the
        familiar positive in First Corinthians 1:28, &quot;God chose . . . even
        things that are not to bring to nothing things that are.&quot; This is
        irony, truth in reverse: the ultimate reality for Epicurus was the
        atoms, physical realities, ironically &quot;the things that are&quot;;
        the ultimate realities for Paul were God and the love of God, spiritual
        realities, ironically &quot;the things that are not.&quot; Here we
        observe the logic of the atom in opposition to the logic of the cross.
        The latter is the familiar positive, the former the now unfamiliar
        negative, lost to our knowledge by fault of inherited prejudice.</p>
        <p align="justify">While the theme of divine love is claiming our
        attention it may improve our understanding of it to mention an item of
        Epicurean reasoning that applies here and must have been known to Paul.
        The proud Plato, who was suspicious of pleasure, held to the view that a
        virtuous action might or might not be accompanied by pleasure. Epicurus
        retorted vigorously that virtue and pleasure were inseparable; the good
        life and the happy life could no more be separated from each other than
        heat could be separated from fire, whiteness from snow, or sweetness
        from honey.</p>
        <p align="justify">No doubt can exist that Paul thought of divine love
        after the same formula; love is an attribute inseparable from God. One
        can think of love apart from God but to think of God apart from love is
        impossible.</p>
        <p align="justify">It deserves our notice that Paul never goes so far as
        to identify God with love, as we find this done in First John 4:8
        &quot;for God is love.&quot; He consistently holds to the view that love
        is an inseparable attribute of God. He did, of course, identify the love
        of God with the love of Christ and we shall make an addition to our
        understanding of divine love if we scrutinize anew the familiar words of
        Ephesians 3:19 &quot;and come to know the love of Christ, which passes
        knowledge.&quot; This is paradoxical: how can one come to know something
        that passes knowledge? What is the lurking assumption in this syncopated
        reasoning?</p>
        <p align="justify">What Paul silently assumes is the principle that on
        the spiritual level of knowledge there is only one canon of truth, the
        gift of the Spirit, as we find it stated in First Corinthians 2:15
        &quot;The spiritual man judges all things, but is himself judged by no
        one.&quot; On another level of knowledge another canon may hold valid;
        for example, on the level of the concrete the Sensations as espoused by
        Epicurus may be valid criteria; the criterion of color is in the eyes
        and the eyes alone. By a like reasoning the knowledge of the love of God
        is attainable only by the gift of the Spirit and so may be said to pass
        understanding by any other criterion of truth. Hence the paradoxical
        idea, &quot;come to know the love of Christ, which passes
        knowledge.&quot; It is understandable through &quot;the wisdom of
        God&quot; but not through &quot;the wisdom of the world.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This line of reasoning would never have been employed
        unless Epicurus had first habituated the public mind to the notion of a
        canon or criterion of knowledge.</p>
        <p align="justify">We may perhaps arrive at even greater precision in
        our understanding of divine love if we scan its relationship to faith;
        and this will bring to our notice yet another of our beloved
        mistranslations, Galatians 5:6 &quot;For in Christ Jesus neither
        circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith that worketh
        through love.&quot; Faith by its very nature is an inert thing; it is a
        passive attitude. If the depositor has faith in his bank, he has no need
        to take action. It follows that faith, being by nature a passive
        attitude, stands in need of an activator, and in the sphere of conduct
        this function is performed by love. Love is a dynamic thing; unless it
        manifests itself in action, it forfeits its right to the name of love.
        So the love of Christ may be defined as faith at work.</p>
        <p align="justify">We may consequently improve our translation by
        reading: &quot;faith that is activated through love&quot; or &quot;faith
        that is stimulated to action through love.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">We may advance our understanding to yet another notch
        of exactitude by glancing at the Old Testament. There we shall find that
        love is demanded by God and required by law, Deuteronomy 6:5 &quot;And
        thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
        soul, and with all thy might.&quot; According to Paul, on the contrary,
        love is offered rather than demanded by God; all that is required of the
        individual is to make a voluntary bid for the recognition of God and by
        virtue of this recognition he begins to participate in the love of God.
        This idea awaits amplification in the chapter to follow.</p>
        <p align="justify">We shall also attain a higher degree of clarity if we
        observe that in the Old Testament we are dealing with a jealous God and
        a vengeful God, &quot;visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
        children,&quot; as we read in Exodus 20:5. This God is also an officer
        of law enforcement, who holds over violators the threat of punishment:
        &quot;the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
        vain,&quot; as we read in verse 7 of the above chapter.</p>
        <p align="justify">This idea of jealous and vengeful gods was merely one
        item in a comprehensive controversy over the nature of divine beings
        that flourished throughout the three centuries preceding the times of
        Jesus and Paul. No better evidence of the existence of this controversy
        need be cited than the fact that Cicero published a major work entitled <i>On
        the Nature of the Gods</i>. Cicero's voice was never one to be heard
        crying in the wilderness; no topic was attractive to him until other men
        had created a market for his views. To illustrate: Epicurus had derided
        all prophecy; Cicero treated the topic under the heading of Divination.</p>
        <p align="justify">If reference to conditions in Rome may seem at first
        sight somewhat farfetched and surprising, we need to be reminded that
        Rome, even before the Christian era, was part of the market for Greek
        books and learning. What may well be more surprising, it had become a
        center of production for Greek books. For example, the writings of the
        Epicurean physician Asclepiades, who was admired by Cicero himself, were
        vigorously attacked by the last great medical writer of antiquity,
        Galen, whose home was in Asia. There is also reason for suspecting that
        the views of this Asclepiades on diet and the use of wine for the sick
        were known to Luke and Paul.</p>
        <p align="justify">Distinctly more significant for the purposes of the
        present inquiry were the writings of the Epicurean Philodemus, who also
        enjoyed the respect of Cicero. Though he was writing in Rome, the market
        for his publications extended eastward over the whole domain of Greek
        culture. Some of his writings were certainly known to Paul and this may
        well be true of three volumes composed by him under the title <i>On the
        Gods</i>, still extant in ampler fragments than is usual.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this work he stressed the friendliness of the
        gods: &quot;The gods are friends of the wise and the wise are friends of
        the gods.&quot; Moreover, since in the language of Epicurus friendship
        and love are denoted by one and the same word, we may quite justly amend
        the above saying to read: &quot;The gods are lovers of the wise and the
        wise are lovers of the gods.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It follows from this fact that the disciples of
        Epicurus, long before the days of the New Testament, were habituating
        the public mind of the time to a concept of divine love that was by no
        means negligible. Epicurus himself had drilled these disciples to
        associate no idea with the divine nature that would detract from its
        sanctity and majesty. In the very first of his Authorized Doctrines he
        had asserted the immunity of the divine nature to the passion of anger.
        Anger in the view of the Greeks was a feeling that one had been injured
        or the fear that one might be injured. How could such a feeling be
        ascribed to a &quot;blessed and incorruptible being&quot; without
        detracting from its claim to reverence by man? Anger by its very nature
        is a confession to weakness, which cannot be associated with a god.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the light of this information it should not be
        astonishing that the jealous, wrathful, and threatening Jehovah of the
        Old Testament has been transformed into the God of love in the New
        Testament. The concept of the supreme being had changed in pace with the
        change in the concept of deity in the public mind. All the armament of
        ridicule and reason that Epicurus had invented to revolutionize the
        pagan concept of deity was infinitely more applicable to Judaism in
        later days, because no god in the Greek pantheon had even approximated
        to the pre-eminence of Jehovah as a lawgiver and a stern officer of law
        enforcement.</p>
        <p align="justify">This revolution in the concept of God was bound to
        raise the logical difficulty of reconciling the previous fear of God
        with the new love of God. This difficulty is not specifically solved by
        Paul but did not escape the attention of John, who sometimes cures the
        omissions of Paul. The solution is found in the first Epistle, fourth
        chapter, and especially verse 18: &quot;There is no fear in love, but
        perfect love casteth out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and
        he who fears is not perfected in love.&quot; Thus Christianity comes
        around to the position of Epicureanism; Philodemus specifically states
        that the divine being is not to be feared, though he can love and be
        loved.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet even if Paul omitted to deal specifically with
        the logical clash between fear and love, it is manifest that the
        reconciliation of the two with each other had been effected in his own
        mind. The fear of God in his revised theology is no longer the fear of
        punishment but merely reverential fear, the fear of God's displeasure.
        The law has been superseded. God no longer demands and commands the love
        of man for himself; he makes the offer of his own love to mankind.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Brotherly Love</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">It is not astonishing, however, that Paul was not
        always consistent. He had four personalities to keep in coordination,
        which originated as follows: from a Jewish childhood; from a Greek
        adolescence; from graduate study in Jerusalem under Gamaliel, in what an
        eminent Jewish scholar calls &quot;Talmudic casuistry&quot;; and
        finally, from his own experience on the road to Damascus.</p>
        <p align="justify">As a Jewish boy he would have learned the Old
        Testament stories and memorized the Commandments and much of the law.
        From this experience would have come the recollection that brotherly
        love had been commanded in a context of threat and revenge, Leviticus
        19:18 &quot;Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the
        children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I
        am the Lord.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This ingrained association of brotherly love with the
        opposite, the spirit of revenge, asserts itself in the twelfth chapter
        of Romans. In verse 10 Paul writes: &quot;Love one another with
        brotherly affection&quot;; and shortly afterward he adds in verse 19:
        &quot;Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of
        God; for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the
        Lord'.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If now we turn from this Old Testament habit of
        opposing brotherly love to vengefulness and cast a scrutinizing glance
        at Paul's ecstatic hymn to love in First Corinthians 13, we shall
        discover an opposition of ideas that is quite different. Unselfish
        brotherly love is set over against the &quot;sounding brass&quot; of
        self-advertising egotism or arrogance. This is undeniably the Epicurean
        device of opposing &quot;the vice to the corresponding virtue.&quot;
        Moreover, as will be demonstrated in the following chapter of this
        study, the beloved verse that begins &quot;Love beareth all
        things,&quot; if rightly interpreted, enshrines four qualities of true
        love or friendship according to Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">This may be surprising but yet another surprise is at
        hand. In the very next verse we read: &quot;Love never ends.&quot; This
        means that love is an attribute of God himself and so is eternal. The
        man who here speaks is the regenerate Paul, the man who was reborn on
        the way to Damascus. No other man would have discerned that love is
        greater than faith and hope, because love is of the nature of God, while
        faith and hope belong only to the experience of man. This teaching calls
        for amplification, which may be found in the chapter following.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the meanwhile it will repay the effort to attempt
        a retrospective survey of the findings of the present chapter. These
        findings will perhaps set themselves in order if we examine first the
        mind of Paul and then the minds of those to whom he addressed his
        gospel.</p>
        <p align="justify">We have found Paul to be capable of thinking and
        writing in four ways: first, as a Jew with orthodox training in
        childhood; second, as a man of Greek education with liberal tendencies;
        third, as a pupil of Gamaliel; and lastly, as an individual, a man
        transformed by a singular and explosive religious experience.</p>
        <p align="justify">The public mind, by way of contrast, had long been
        habituated to the point of saturation with the analysis, criticism, and
        discussion of the essentials of ethics, religion, and irreligion. In
        this welter of intellectual activity the Epicureans and Stoics alone had
        positive and practical teachings to offer; but the Stoics, by their
        asperity and censoriousness and their logic-chopping, limited their
        appeal and their numbers. The Epicureans, on the contrary, by virtue of
        their inveterate friendliness and perspicuous reasonings, enjoyed the
        most numerous following.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was consequently with this sect that Paul
        experienced the chief affinity at the same time that it furnished the
        sharpest criticism and competition. These Epicureans stressed the
        importance of brotherly love, though they called it friendship. They
        stressed also the importance of faith, though it meant for them faith in
        doctrine, faith in leaders, and faith in friends. They stressed also the
        importance of attitudes: gratitude for past pleasures and the hope of
        pleasures to come.</p>
        <p align="justify">This structure of ethics either fortuitously or
        providentially operated as a bridge of transition to Paul's structure of
        doctrine. Brotherly love still occupies a foremost position but is
        transcended by the love of God. Faith in doctrine and in friends is
        still valid as a factor of conduct but is transcended by faith in the
        resurrected Christ along with intimations of an expanding religious
        experience, &quot;from faith to faith.&quot; Neither is hope denied its
        validity in the domain of happy human relations but it acquires a new
        and specific meaning as the confident expectation of the second coming
        and its precious implications.

        that the passages of Paul's Epistles which we most
        prefer as devotional readings exhibit the most influence of Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">Among the foremost of these is the hymn to love, the
        thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians. It falls into two parts: the
        first seven verses are a unit, as also the last six. The theme of the
        first unit is brotherly love, which, like faith and hope, should prevail
        on earth; the theme of the second unit is divine love, which is eternal
        and will prevail in heaven.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the hymn as a whole there is a crescendo of
        interest, importance, and, it must be added, of difficulty. This
        difficulty has its basis in two hidden assumptions of Paul's thought,
        without which exact understanding is impossible. The first assumption is
        that of the interim, which conditions Paul's thinking, the feeling that
        men of his generation were living under temporary conditions; the second
        assumption is that of recognition, the belief that mutual recognition
        occurs between man and God at the moment of profession of faith and
        continues as a progressive experience in the Christian life, arriving at
        a climax on the last day, the end of the interim.</p>
        <p align="justify">The concept of the interim will turn out to be Jewish
        in origin while the concept of recognition will be identified as a
        constituent of the philosophy and literature of Greece. The interaction
        of the two, when once apprehended, will furnish a key to the formulation
        of Paul's doctrine and exemplify at the same time the process of
        transition from philosophy to religion.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the study of brotherly love the chief assistance
        will come from a knowledge of Epicurean ethics. By the help of this, in
        particular, the euphonious obscurity of &quot;Love beareth all
        things&quot; and the rest of verse 7 may be replaced by precision and
        lucidity.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the second half of the chapter the chief
        assistance will come from a knowledge of the teachings of Epicurus about
        the attitude of the gods toward mankind. To be specific, his assertion
        of the complete aloofness of the gods to human affairs was a challenge
        to Paul to assert the recognition of man by God, a doctrine which he
        elaborated. In this instance the repulsive force of the teaching of
        Epicurus furnished the stimulus to invent and refine the substitute
        doctrine.</p>
        <p align="justify">Lastly, another of our familiar mistranslations,
        &quot;And now abideth faith, hope, charity,&quot; will be corrected in
        the light of the concept of the interim.</p>

        </font><font face="Arial" size="3">Sounding Brass</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">As a prelude to the study of brotherly love an
        elucidation is due to be made, long overdue, in fact, of the innuendo of
        &quot;sounding brass&quot; and &quot;tinkling cymbal,&quot; with which
        Paul's hymn begins. In order to rescue this innuendo from the obscurity
        shed over it by the lapse of time, recourse must be taken to a quick
        glance at Greek religion.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the great age of Greece there were but a few
        oracles, Apollo's at Delphi enjoying a solitary precedence. This was
        consulted almost exclusively by governments, kings, and princes. In the
        course of time, as aristocratic societies were leveled down and the
        political centers of gravity shifted elsewhere, a multitude of local
        oracles and other devices of prediction rose to popularity. Most of
        these made a prey of superstitious people, just as organized gambling in
        our own time makes capital of events in the future for the exploitation
        of light-minded and improvident individuals.</p>
        <p align="justify">Some of the new prophetic cults were imported from
        Asia and Egypt and from the former came the most notorious, the worship
        of Cybele, so-called Mother of the Gods, chiefly associated with Mount
        Berecynthus in Phrygia. It was the most notorious because it took the
        form of a traveling religious circus, going from city to city and
        bringing prophecy to the door of the consumer, as it were.</p>
        <p align="justify">The image of the goddess, represented as a portly
        dame with a turreted crown upon her head, was borne in procession
        through the streets, bobbing this way and that upon the back of an
        unfortunate ass. She was accompanied by a throng of weird attendants
        jangling tambourines, beating drums, clashing cymbals, and blowing huge
        horns of brass. Flowers and coins were strewn in their path by
        superstitious multitudes, roused to hysteria by the spectacle of an
        exotic mystery religion gauged to their own vulgar level. Of this
        excitement the priests took advantage by telling fortunes for such fees
        as could be extorted from their victims.</p>
        <p align="justify">These barbarian priests were infamous for their
        egotism and effrontery, and all the instruments of their worship became
        symbols of self-advertising, often known to the ancients as vainglory or
        self-love. For example, in the very lifetime of Christ there flourished
        in Rome a Greek poet named Apion, especially notorious for egotism. He
        was styled by the philosopher Seneca &quot;the drum of his own
        fame,&quot; but it remained for the Emperor Tiberius to dub him, with a
        grimness of satire characteristic of the Romans, &quot;the cymbal of the
        universe,&quot; which meant the greatest egotist on earth.</p>
        <p align="justify">This noisy worship of Cybele was in the mind of Paul
        when he took up his pen to write First Corinthians 13; he was calling
        attention to a vice in order to gain attention for the corresponding
        virtue, branding with scorn the self-advertising egotism of the pagan
        priests in order to gain increased esteem for self-obliterating
        brotherly love. It is consequently an error to follow the Revised
        Standard Version and change &quot;sounding brass&quot; to a &quot;noisy
        gong.&quot; The reference is to the huge brass horn<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        of Cybele's worshipers, which was an object of common knowledge. Even
        in Rome it had the same significance, as is evidenced by lines of the
        poet Horace, who died a scant four years before the birth of Christ, <i>Odes</i>
        1:18: &quot;Silence the made tambourines and the Berecynthian horn, of
        which the handmaids are blind self-love and vainglory, tossing an empty
        head too high.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If the merits of translations be weighed, it will be
        difficult to improve upon &quot;sounding brass,&quot; but a bit more
        precision of connotation may be gained by &quot;blaring horn&quot; or
        &quot;blaring brass.&quot; As for &quot;clanging cymbal,&quot; this is
        an improvement over &quot;tinkling cymbal,&quot; but &quot;blatant
        cymbal&quot; will be closer to the Greek, which suggests a vulgar bid
        for public attention.</p>
        <p align="justify">Our understanding of still another verse may possibly
        be bettered if we keep this topic of self-love or egotism well in mind;
        and we shall be justified in so doing, because Paul is very tenacious of
        his topic. Let us then reconsider the words, &quot;and though I have all
        faith, so that I could remove mountains.&quot; This can hardly mean
        faith in God, which is incompatible with egotism. It must rather mean
        faith in one's self, self-confidence. The reference will then be to
        boastful Homeric heroes, such as Ajax, who, having spent his weapons,
        seizes upon a huge rock, &quot;such as two men would not avail to
        lift,&quot; and hurls it at his foe. This innuendo, obscured for us,
        would have been a schoolboy commonplace to Greeks. In their schools they
        memorized Homer, and the Homeric heroes were notorious for
        self-glorification.</p>
        <p align="justify">Two notes of interest and importance remain to be
        recorded upon this topic of self-love. We still possess in extensive
        fragments a treatise by the Epicurean Philodemus of Gadara under the
        title of <i>Pride or Arrogance</i>, which is a synonym for the same
        vice. In this treatise he makes the significant observation that with
        the proud or arrogant man no cooperation is possible. That brotherly
        love, on the contrary, signifies sympathetic consideration for others
        and consequently renders feasible the working together that was to
        characterize each Christian group is made clear in verse 7, of which a
        new interpretation and translation will presently be offered.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul is here treading in the footsteps of Epicurus,
        as will be made clear by the second of the two notes that were promised.
        The treatise of Philodemus on <i>Pride or Arrogance</i> was the tenth
        book of his comprehensive study entitled <i>On Vices and the
        Corresponding Virtues.</i> How often Paul availed himself of this device
        of opposing the vice to the virtue has been abundantly demonstrated
        already. In this particular chapter he leads off by denouncing the vice
        of egotism or self-love before describing the virtue. When he comes to
        describe the virtue, he turns the Epicurean device of instruction into a
        trick of style, a most effective trick, which consists in defining the
        virtue by the vice, as in verses 4-5: &quot;Love is patient and kind;
        love is <i>not</i> jealous or boastful; it is <i>not</i> arrogant or
        rude.&quot; No small part of the charm of this chapter as a devotional
        reading depends upon this adopted antithesis.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Love Hopeth All Things</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Conspicuous among the many merits of this hymn to
        love is a rhythm of phrasing that awakens in the subconscious mind the
        memory of certain psalms. The effect depends in the main upon the
        repetition of a given pattern of words, which may be observed at its
        best in the King James version of verse 7: &quot;Beareth all things,
        believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.&quot; This
        charm is by no means accidental, because there is an unmistakable vein
        of poetry in Paul's disposition, and it may be said of his Epistles
        that, like the King James Version itself, they were &quot;appointed to
        be read in churches.&quot; Nevertheless it may be added without
        hesitation that he stopped short of sacrificing the meaning for the sake
        of the sound, as if a light-minded poetaster or a shallow rhetorician.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is consequently justifiable to ask ourselves what
        meaning really lies concealed beneath the gentle rhythm of this
        memorable verse. The meaning is certainly not on the surface, or if it
        is, we are no longer conditioned to apprehend it. What, then, would it
        have suggested to the Corinthians?</p>
        <p align="justify">Our disability arises in part from the fact that we
        do not call love and friendship by the same name, as did both Epicurus
        and Paul. To Epicurus both were <i>philia;</i> to Paul both were <i>agape.</i></p>
        <p align="justify">Both words would have been familiar to Paul's readers
        in Corinth and both words would have signified friendship as well as
        love. If, then, we English readers can only divest ourselves of the
        habit of separating friendship from love, we shall have taken the first
        step toward recognizing in this seventh verse four qualities of true
        friendship according to the creed of Epicurus. It will be well to have
        the text before us: &quot;Love beareth all things, believeth all things,
        hopeth all things, endureth all things.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">A single searching glance will reveal that something
        is amiss. What is the difference, for example, between &quot;beareth all
        things&quot; and &quot;endureth all things&quot;? This is sheer
        tautology and Paul thinks too precisely and writes too precisely to be
        guilty of it. There must be an error of translation in one or the other.
        It turns out to be in the former. The Greek text does not read &quot;beareth
        all things&quot; but &quot;keeps secret all things,&quot; or something
        similar. What this means, in turn, may readily be explained by recourse
        to Epicureanism.</p>
        <p align="justify">To Epicurus love was friendship and friendship
        demanded loyalty. &quot;Incorruptible loyalty&quot; was the virtue
        chosen by the poet Horace to describe a deceased Epicurean friend.
        Moreover, men ought to feel gratitude for friendship and, according to
        Epicurus, &quot;The wise man alone will feel true gratitude and in
        respect of his friends, <i>whether present or absent,</i> will be of the
        same mind throughout the journey of life.&quot; This means that the
        loyal friend will not belittle his friend behind his back or endure to
        hear him belittled. He will know his faults but will not be guilty of
        letting them become the topic of conversation with others.</p>
        <p align="justify">Even more precision is possible. The members of each
        Epicurean group were committed to the practice of mutual admonition.
        They were to confide in one another. Paul fostered a like practice in
        his own churches, though he never seems to mention the virtue of
        confession so specifically as it is found in the Epistle of James, 5:16:
        &quot;Confess your faults to one another.&quot; It is in his mind,
        however, and part of his meaning is that these confidences must be
        respected. It is for this reason that he writes: &quot;Love keeps secret
        all things.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If, then, we aim at a version that will include both
        loyal silence concerning a friend's faults and loyal respect for faults
        confessed, we may suggest, &quot;Love is always trustworthy.&quot;
        Defined by its opposite, the virtue may be worded, &quot;Love never is
        false to a friend&quot; or &quot;Love never betrays a confidence.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The second phrase in verse 7, &quot;believeth all
        things,&quot; is equally vague and obscure as we have it. This should
        rather be rendered, &quot;Love is always trustful.&quot; This virtue is
        reciprocal to the former. Just as the true friend will always be loyal,
        so he will believe his friends to be worthy of loyalty. He will not be
        suspicious.</p>
        <p align="justify">This topic of suspicion was a hackneyed one in
        ancient literature. Tyrants were notoriously distrustful of friends and
        would often ply them with wine in order to discover their real feelings.
        Hence the familiar saying, <i>in vino veritas,</i> that is,
        &quot;Drunken men tell the truth.&quot; This trickery was specifically
        denounced by Epicurus; he is on record as saying that the wise man, who
        is to him the good man, &quot;certainly will not watch men in their
        cups.&quot; He is also on record as repudiating the compulsory sharing
        of goods, &quot;because that sort of thing was for those who did not
        trust one another, and if for such, it was not for friends.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It is the recognition of such teachings that demands
        the change from the obscure &quot;believeth all things&quot; to
        &quot;Love is always trustful.&quot; Defined by its opposite, this
        means, &quot;Love is never suspicious.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Just as love or friendship must be both trustworthy
        and trustful at all times, so it must also be hopeful, and this is the
        meaning of &quot;hopeth all things.&quot; As made plain already in the
        foregoing chapter, in the ethic of Epicurus hopefulness is an attitude
        toward the future, deliberately chosen and pragmatically justified. It
        is assumed that the individual's experience can and must be controlled,
        the whole life must be rationally planned so as to ensure peace of mind
        and health of body, and this planning justifies the hope of pleasures to
        come.</p>
        <p align="justify">This attitude is an essential of the happy life; not
        only is the individual the happier for being hopeful; he contributes
        also to the happiness of others. The virtue is social. So, instead of
        &quot;Love hopeth all things,&quot; we may better read, &quot;Love is
        always hopeful.&quot; Defining the virtue by its opposite, we may write:
        &quot;Love is never pessimistic.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The last item in the list, &quot;endureth all
        things,&quot; must, like the others, be interpreted in the sphere of
        human relations. We may be helped by knowledge of a running controversy
        between Epicureans and Stoics. The latter maintained that all offenses
        are equal; the man who steals a cabbage from his neighbor's garden is no
        less guilty than the man who robs a temple. The Epicureans, a charitable
        and forgiving sect, took a different view; they believed in making the
        punishment fit the crime.</p>
        <p align="justify">Their attitude toward the trifling faults and
        frailties of their fellow men was similar. Epicurus himself laid stress
        upon the virtue that may be called considerateness; in his definition it
        approximates to the Golden Rule, though it falls short of recommending
        to turn the other cheek. Here are his words: &quot;We value our own
        characters just as we do our private property, whether or not this be of
        the best and such as men would covet for themselves; in the same way we
        ought to have respect for the characters of others, if they are
        considerate.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This seems to be a rather novel way of looking at
        neighborly relations. Your neighbor's character, Epicurus seems to say,
        deserves to be treated with the same respect as his house. To modernize
        the application of this, if the mere thought of smashing a neighbor's
        windows would shame a man, why should not the thought of belittling his
        personality seem equally shameful? He may have his faults and defects.
        He may be extremely economical but this is no valid excuse for calling
        him Pinchpenny. His disposition may be unduly mild but this would not
        justify dubbing him Milquetoast. He may have a long visage but he need
        not be called Horseface. He may talk too much but this would not excuse
        the gibe of Gabby Jones. Have we no faults or defects ourselves?
        Forbearance should be mutual.</p>
        <p align="justify">Therefore, instead of &quot;Love endureth all
        things,&quot; we may more correctly read, &quot;Love is always
        tolerant.&quot; The negative version will be, &quot;Love is never
        censorious.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The whole verse may now be rendered with more
        precision than before: &quot;Love is always trustworthy, always
        trustful, always hopeful, always tolerant.&quot; The negative versions
        will run: &quot;Love is never treacherous, never suspicious, never
        pessimistic, never censorious.&quot;</p>

        <p align="justify">At this point it will be profitable to pause and take
        a second and more discerning glance over the structure of this
        fascinating chapter. From the Hebrew point of view it seems to be a
        psalm of love; it exhibits a rhythm of language that harmonizes aptly
        with the rhythm of thought; one sentiment follows another like gentle
        waves lapping upon a beach, after the fashion of the twenty-third psalm.</p>
        <p align="justify">At the same time we catch the glimmer of Greek
        philosophy. When we read, &quot;Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth
        in the truth,&quot; this must be recognized as the Epicurean device of
        instruction, employed here as a trick of style, again opposing &quot;the
        vice to the corresponding virtue.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">From another point of view this chapter may with
        equal propriety be regarded as an ode to love in the Greek manner. The
        Greek ode exhibits a definite pattern of arrangement. The thought moves
        lightly from one aspect to another of a single theme, following a chosen
        association of ideas, which may conceal a genuine logic.</p>
        <p align="justify">Such is the procedure here. The first aspect of love
        is the ugly one, egotism or self-love, which blows its own horn and
        beats the drum of its own fame. Next come the dual aspects of love, the
        virtues defined by the vices. Last comes the summary in verse 7, four
        aspects of true brotherly love or friendship.</p>
        <p align="justify">The rest of this hybrid of poetical invention, psalm
        of love or ode to love, verses 8-13, presents new aspects of the
        pervading theme, which cannot be understood unless the assumptions that
        underlie them have been detected and rendered explicit. These
        assumptions have been obscured for the modern reader by the ruthless
        march of time, although to ancient readers they were the veriest
        commonplace.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Interim</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The first of these assumptions may be called the idea
        of the interim, by which is signified Paul's conviction that the
        generation to which he belonged was living under temporary conditions.
        The termination of this interim was to be marked by the second coming of
        Christ, the signal for the general resurrection. The prior limit of the
        interim was the resurrection of Christ himself. Thus Paul's generation
        was thought to be living in the interim of time between the two
        resurrections.</p>
        <p align="justify">It may go without saying that this notion of an
        interim was not original with Paul but in one form or another had been a
        component of public thought from a date long before this time.</p>
        <p align="justify">We should find the history of the idea both
        interesting and profitable. For the purpose of detecting its origin a
        principle espoused by Epicurus himself may prove useful. It was his
        contention that Nature, the sole creatrix, manifests herself in the
        cumulative experience of each race and in the aggregate experience of
        mankind. History is thus the evolution of the unintended. This implies
        that actions always precede words and events precede ideas.</p>
        <p align="justify">To apply this principle to the notion of the interim,
        the event that preceded and was the cause of it was the downfall of the
        kingdom in Israel. The reaction of the Hebrew prophets to this event was
        to predict the restoration of the kingdom and to this end a divine king
        must come with supernatural power, that is, the Messiah.</p>
        <p align="justify">Such, then, was the origin of the notion of the
        interim; in its original form it was the space of time between the
        downfall of the kingdom and the expected restoration. It manifested
        itself in the public mind as a sense of temporariness in things,
        sometimes contemplated with fear and despair, sometimes with ardent
        hope. The speed with which it took possession of the mind of Israel is
        not astonishing, because the mass opinion of the race had long been
        shaped to a major degree by prophecy; but the rapidity with which it
        extended itself to neighboring peoples is truly astounding. The savior
        sentiment became a universal component of the public imagination.</p>
        <p align="justify">The sense of temporariness and expectancy imparted a
        tremendous impulse to the arts of prophecy. The picayune predictions of
        Apollo were suddenly outmoded and his very name became obscured in the
        growing popularity of his own priestesses, the Sibyllae, who began to
        chart the future in the grander style of the Hebrews. Their language
        alone was Greek.</p>
        <p align="justify">Astrology also sprang to sudden popularity and swept
        rapidly from east to west. The comet that appeared after the murder of
        Julius Caesar gave a smart fillip to the notion of the savior star. The
        star, the Sibyl, and the divine child were all celebrated in the poetry
        of Virgil before the birth of Christ. The glamour of these oriental
        ideas attached itself to the name of Caesar, the more readily because
        the Romans themselves, long plagued by civil wars, had become conscious
        of living in an interim of time. It should not be astonishing,
        therefore, that when order seemed to have been restored at last, a
        superstitious senate conferred upon the younger Caesar the title of
        Augustus, which is as close as the Latin language can approach to the
        idea of &quot;the anointed one.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Having clearly apprehended this notion of the
        interim, we can now discern a serious mistranslation in the last verse
        of this challenging chapter, &quot;but the greatest of these is
        love.&quot; Paul reasons precisely and writes precisely and we ought to
        translate him precisely. It is not the superlative degree of the
        adjective that he here employs but the comparative, and what he writes
        means &quot;but love ranks higher than these.&quot; He does not tell us
        but leaves it to us to discern that faith and hope are not of the nature
        of God himself but belong exclusively to human experience. They are
        virtues of the interim and being such will terminate, while love, being
        of the nature of God himself, will never end. It is for this reason that
        love ranks higher.</p>
        <p align="justify">The correction of the translation, however, must
        await a fuller discussion of the notion of the interim.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Knowledge and the Interim</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">We must next observe that belief in the interim
        reacts also upon the thinker's conception of knowledge. Epicurus, for
        example, believing as he did that mortal life is an interim between two
        eternities of unconsciousness, was bound also to assume that the only
        kind of knowledge is that which characterizes the interim of mortal
        life. There was nothing in consequence to deter him from judging his own
        system of knowledge to be perfect, which he did; he called it &quot;true
        reason&quot; or &quot;true philosophy&quot; or simply &quot;truth&quot;
        and his disciples boasted of their devotion to this &quot;truth.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul, with his usual acumen, pounced upon this
        assumption of perfection and proceeded to belittle it as a fallacy.
        Believing as he did in the temporariness of things, he was bound to
        believe also in two kinds of knowledge, the one of the interim and
        imperfect, the other of eternity and perfect. From this it followed by
        cogent inference that the philosophy of Epicurus must be of this
        transitory world and by virtue of this fact imperfect.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        When I Was a Child</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">If this argument commends itself as a shrewd one, it
        still falls short of revealing the full measure of Paul's acumen. He
        casually presses the same logic to another notch and denominates the
        philosophy of Epicurus as doubly inferior, first, because it is of this
        temporary world and consequently imperfect, and second, because it is
        typical of the shorter interim of human life that we call adolescence
        and consequently juvenile.</p>
        <p align="justify">It may, of course, seem to be a sort of vandalism to
        seize upon this gem of diction out of the King James Bible, the verse
        that begins &quot;When I was a child, I spake as a child,&quot; jettison
        all the pensive sentiment it inevitably evokes, and discern beneath the
        pensiveness, which we falsely read into it, a biting specimen of logical
        satire; but, if our quest be the discovery of Paul's meaning and if this
        quest is not to be relinquished, then as satire it must be identified.
        It may even happen that a new and worthier pensiveness may be restored
        to it.</p>
        <p align="justify">Already in the study of Galatians 4:3 we have
        discovered the use of the word <i>child</i> to be an error of
        translation. The Greek word, it is true, means an infant in the sense
        that English law regards all individuals short of legal age as infants;
        but the word has connotations outside of law. To Paul it denotes one who
        has not yet arrived at the age of discretion, mental maturity. So in
        Galatians 4:3 we have emended the translation to read: &quot;When we
        were juveniles, we were slaves to the elements of the universe.&quot;
        This means that in the interim of adolescence we were captivated by the
        philosophy of Epicurus.</p>
        <p align="justify">If by this time we have achieved willingness to
        sacrifice an exquisite specimen of simple diction for the sake of the
        real meaning, verse 11 may be paraphrased as follows: &quot;When I was a
        sophomore, I used to indulge in reckless talk, the way sophomores do; I
        used to entertain wild ideas, the way sophomores do; I used to startle
        people with smart arguments, the way sophomores do. When I became a real
        adult person, I made an end of such antics.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The reference, overt to ancient readers though covert
        to us, is to the Epicureans. Paul is mocking the mockers, tossing back
        from his own trench a grenade of their throwing. It was their pleasure
        to ridicule the idea of the resurrection as silliness; it was his
        pleasure to damn their brand of knowledge as typical of the folly of
        adolescence. In his view of things the interim of time in which his
        generation was living was bound to be characterized by imperfection of
        knowledge but the creed of Epicurus was of a quality much lower; it was
        excusable only as the irresponsible thinking of the smaller interim of
        adolescence, something that was part of the process of growing up but
        due to be outgrown.</p>
        <p align="justify">Having improved our understanding of this verse by a
        paraphrase, perhaps we may gain further benefit by a sort of parody,
        dilating the innocent language of the King James Version to admit
        authenticated items of Epicurean doctrine, such as Paul detested:
        &quot;The age of adolescence will talk recklessly as if the only things
        that are not seen are beggarly specks of matter called atoms; it will
        have wild ideas as if God lived aloof to the affairs of mankind; it will
        shock pious people by adducing reasons for believing that the world was
        no more created for the sake of man than for the sake of beetles.&quot;</p>

        <font face="Arial">Now We See in a Mirror, Indistinctly</font></font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Having thoroughly discounted the philosophy of
        materialism by an innuendo perspicuous at the time, though for us
        understandable only by paraphrase and parody, Paul resumes his theme
        with a variation, as befits the author of an ode. Neither is it
        unbefitting that this variation is a figure of speech, slightly obscure
        for us, though less so than the innuendo that precedes. The ancients
        knew only mirrors of bronze, darker than brass at best, and usually
        tarnished. So we should read: &quot;Now we see in a mirror,
        indistinctly, but then face to face.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">To us modern readers this seemingly innocent verse
        may be an invitation to relaxation of mind and the contemplative mood,
        but in reality it is packed with meaning and should be challenging to
        the attention. Individual words will be found to repay separate
        scrutiny, and hints will be uncovered of the unexpressed assumptions of
        Paul's thought and also of the public mind of his time. An immediate
        reward will be the promised correction of the translation, though
        additional dividends of value will also accrue.</p>
        <p align="justify">When Paul writes &quot;Now we see,&quot; his specific
        reference is to the temporary conditions of the interim of time in which
        he believed his own generation to be living, awaiting the second coming;
        when in the next verse he writes &quot;Now I know in part,&quot; the
        reference is the same. When he writes &quot;but then I shall know,&quot;
        the reference is to the occasion of the second coming and its glorious
        sequels.</p>
        <p align="justify">The mistranslation comes in the last verse, which by
        the King James Version is made to begin, &quot;And now abideth faith,
        hope, charity,&quot; and by the Revised Standard, &quot;So faith, hope,
        love abide.&quot; What has been overlooked is the fact that Paul has
        switched from a casual Greek word meaning &quot;now&quot; to an emphatic
        synonym, which may be rendered &quot;as things now are.&quot; This
        correction enables us to detect and correct a second error, which lies
        in &quot;abideth&quot; or &quot;abide.&quot; As already pointed out,
        faith and hope differ from love in being virtues of the interim, which
        terminates at the second coming, while love is eternal, being of the
        nature of God himself. A precise version will then read: &quot;But as
        things now are, faith, hope, love remain valid, these three, but love
        ranks higher than these two.&quot; Faith and hope are appointed to lose
        validity but not love.</p>

        The Concept of Recognition</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The next step for us is to follow up a second clue of
        thought, which has lain unobserved in the verse that mentions the
        mirror. The key words are &quot;indistinctly, but then face to
        face,&quot; which presume a concept of recognition that was part of the
        popular psychology of Paul's time. If this concept shall seem strange to
        us, there is all the more reason for the effort to become familiar with
        it; Paul's reasoning will be found to hinge upon it.</p>
        <p align="justify">To begin at the beginning is a sound plan of
        procedure, even at the risk of being tedious, and this brings us back to
        Epicurus. In the world of Paul he occupied a position not unlike that of
        Sigmund Freud in our own day. Freud, though infinitely irritating, has
        captured the public attention. Epicurus succeeded in holding the
        attention of the ancient world for seven centuries, irritating men over
        the whole period. In the fourth century the Christian Lactantius was
        still smarting over Epicurean ridicule of &quot;the wrath of God,&quot;
        though at the same time conceding that the disciples of Epicurus had
        always outnumbered the adherents of other sects.</p>
        <p align="justify">If in the fourth century it was still impossible for
        Lactantius to ignore Epicureanism, then on the wane, in the first
        century it was infinitely more impossible for Paul to ignore it, because
        it was already popular and widely diffused and still on the increase. It
        was well publicized in handy texts, which were often revised. Among
        these was a standard handbook entitled <i>On the Sensations</i>, the
        work of Metrodorus. From this book and basic writings of Epicurus
        himself were derived certain notions of psychology which then prevailed.
        These enjoyed the greater vogue because the Stoics, always apt at
        imitating success, assisted in the work of popularizing them.</p>
        <p align="justify">We can make immediate progress by becoming acquainted
        with a specimen of Epicurean psychology. The textbooks have perished but
        sufficient evidences survive for the reconstruction of a sample lecture.</p>
        <p align="justify">Let us assume that the observer discerns something
        white moving in the distance in the twilight. It may be a white ox or it
        may be a human being dressed in white. It comes nearer; it is recognized
        to be a human figure. It may be a man or it may be a woman. It comes
        still nearer; it is seen to be a man. It continues to come nearer; it is
        seen to be bearded. As it draws closer it is seen to walk with the
        shoulders slightly stooped. At last it comes into plain view; the
        observer recognizes the man and exclaims, &quot;It is Plato.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Now this exposition, which must needs be made so very
        explicit for the modern man, would have been for intelligent readers of
        Paul's time the sheerest commonplace. They would have been familiar, for
        instance, with the principles illustrated in this synthetic lecture:
        first, the particulars or parts are discerned in advance of the whole;
        second, the act of recognition is a synthesis of the parts or
        particulars; and third, only the immediate sensation is dependable<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
ZH-CN;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>–</span>
        it
        alone results in a definite recognition.</p>
        <p align="justify">Such is the concept of recognition in its simplest
        form; to allow it to grow in our minds will be a revealing experience,
        because it exhibits various aspects.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the meanwhile, what is the application of it? What
        are we to read out of it? We are to read this, that Paul employs the
        then familiar terminology and ideology of sensation in order to explain
        things that lie beyond the range of sensation. We are catching him in
        the very act of making himself &quot;as a Greek to the Greeks,&quot;
        drawing upon the resources of philosophy to build his structure of
        religion.</p>
        <p align="justify">Epicurus divided all existing things into two
        classes: those that lie within the range of sensation and those that lie
        beyond the range of sensation. This may be paraphrased as the seen and
        the unseen, the visible and the invisible. Paul takes over this division
        of things, employing the very same words, <i>orata, aorata,</i> which no
        other writer employs in the New Testament. Yet what a difference of
        application! To Epicurus the invisible things, too minute to be
        discerned by the physical eye, are the atoms, which are eternal. To Paul
        the invisible things are spiritual, God himself, for example, who is
        eternal.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this quest it is vital to observe that the
        knowledge of spiritual things, and the knowledge of God in particular,
        is arrived at through an experience of recognition no less than
        knowledge of physical things, including human beings. In fact there is
        no choice open to Paul but to employ the terminology of physical
        sensation to describe the spiritual experience. It should be recalled
        that only when the approaching figure has come close can the observer
        say, &quot;It is Plato.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">So in Paul's verse, &quot;Now we see in a mirror,
        indistinctly, but then face to face,&quot; the &quot;face to face&quot;
        recognition will be final and decisive. It is just as if the living man,
        caught up in glory on the last day, should exclaim, &quot;This is
        God!&quot; Yet this event, even if comparable to a blinding physical
        experience, will be much more; it will also be a spiritual experience.
        It will be a final realization of the nature of God. It will be an
        experience of recognition.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Aspects of Recognition</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">After this anticipatory glance over the topic of
        recognition we shall profit by attempting a closer scrutiny. It exhibits
        various aspects. It is essentially an experience of discovery and
        operates on all levels of learning, whether sensory, rational, or
        spiritual. On the sensory level we recognize a person; this is a
        discovery of identity only; it answers the question &quot;Who is
        it?&quot; On the rational level we recognize, for example, that Paul has
        a double ethic, one of the interim and destined to terminate at the
        resurrection, the other permanent. This is an experience of the mind. On
        the spiritual level, although we still employ the terminology of sensory
        experience, the question is no longer &quot;Who is it?&quot; but rather
        &quot;What is he like?&quot; or &quot;What is his true nature?&quot; and
        the answer is found in First John 3:2: &quot;We shall see him as he
        is.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Certain special aspects of recognition will next
        claim our attention. When we recognize the identity of a person on the
        street, this is an involuntary act, and we recognize many with whom we
        have no personal acquaintance. In the case of those people who are
        personal friends or acquaintances we may or may not choose to recognize
        them by a greeting or gesture, because this act is voluntary and quite
        distinct from the involuntary recognition of identity.</p>
        <p align="justify">We are now approaching something important. The act
        of recognition may be elevated to the rank of a ritual or a formality.
        For example, the President of the United States on the advice of his
        Cabinet may concede or withhold the recognition of a foreign power. If
        recognition is conceded, the representative of such country is received
        at the White House and welcomed to the circle of foreign ministers.</p>
        <p align="justify">The importance of this aspect of recognition lies in
        the fact that it is part of Paul's mind and unless we apprehend it
        ourselves we shall misunderstand what Paul writes and also mistranslate
        it. An example of this error may be found in First Corinthians 15:34,
        where the Revised Standard reads: &quot;For some have no knowledge of
        God. I say this to your shame.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">If some people have no knowledge of God because they
        were never told about him, this is no reason for shame but rather for
        pity. In point of fact, the question in this instance is not a matter of
        knowledge at all but rather of recognition; the people concerned have
        been told about God and still refuse recognition, which is an affront to
        God. Hence the shame. It is an insult just as the refusal of an
        individual to recognize his superior or the refusal of one government to
        recognize another is an insult.</p>
        <p align="justify">If Paul's words in the above verse be closely
        scrutinized in the Greek, we shall discover that he is not merely
        stating a fact but resorting to an idiom of characterization. He is
        informing the Corinthians of a group among them who know about God but
        are so shameless as to offer him affront by refusing to recognize him.
        In Paul's language, to know God has a technical meaning; no other means
        of entering upon this knowledge exists except to recognize God by
        recognizing the resurrected Christ. The word <i>recognition</i> is also
        technical in force and virtually indispensable. Hence we may translate:
        &quot;For some among you are refusing recognition to God. I say this to
        your shame.&quot;</p>

        Mutual Recognition</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Still other aspects of recognition await exploration.
        The believer's experience of God, which is begun by his recognition of
        the Son of God in the person of the resurrected Christ, is not one-sided
        but reciprocal. At the same moment that the individual recognizes the
        Son he is recognized by the Father. This detail of doctrine finds its
        confirmation in Galatians 4:9: &quot;but now that you have come to know
        God, or rather to be known by God.&quot; This verse not only
        demonstrates the reciprocal nature of the experience but also contains
        the fruitful hint that the recognition of the individual by God is the
        more significant part of the said experience. This aspect of the
        recognition, however, must await its turn elsewhere.</p>
        <p align="justify">Another verse that possesses bearing upon the mutual
        or reciprocal nature of recognition is found in First Corinthians 8:3:
        &quot;But if one loves God, he is known by him.&quot; This is one of
        many instances where Paul's reasoning is highly syncopated. It is here
        plainly implied, though not expressly stated, that knowledge does not
        constitute a valid bid for recognition by God. It &quot;puffs up&quot;
        but has no promise of things to come. It is the love of the individual
        for God that qualifies the individual for recognition by God and
        contains the promise of growth to come.</p>
        <p align="justify">Elsewhere, however, it is the profession of faith in
        the resurrected Christ that constitutes the valid claim for recognition
        by God. By what reasoning, then, can love be substituted for faith? The
        answer may be found in Galatians 5:6, if correctly translated; faith
        must be activated by love. Love, in a sense, is faith at work. If a man
        really loves God, he will also love his neighbor and refrain from
        causing him to do wrong, for example, by eating meat sacrificed to
        idols. By this practical demonstration of brotherly love he will qualify
        for recognition by God and &quot;be known by God.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In order to explore the next aspect of recognition we
        must recall the doctrine of Epicurus which asserted the total
        indifference of the gods toward human wickedness. Reciprocal to this was
        his teaching that these same gods were not indifferent toward the pious.
        His words are worth quoting, not only for their intrinsic importance but
        also because they occur in his letter addressed to a lad Menoeceus, a
        minor gem of Greek literature, which Paul himself gives evidence of
        having known at first hand: &quot;[The gods] being exclusively concerned
        with their own virtues, are receptive toward those like themselves,
        deeming all that is not such as alien.&quot; By their own virtues he
        means chiefly tranquillity, unruffled calm, and it was even his teaching
        that human beings who enjoy such peace of mind may be visited by filmy
        images of the gods, too subtle to be apprehended by the eyes of the
        flesh but capable of being perceived by the mind.</p>
        <p align="justify">The significance to be observed in this teaching is
        the implied suggestion of the recognition of the pious by the gods.
        Philodemus was slightly more specific in declaring that &quot;the gods
        are friends of the wise and the wise are friends of the gods.&quot; The
        concept of recognition, however, failed to click and this in spite of
        the fact that it was well understood in Epicurean psychology.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was Paul who seized upon this concept and
        elaborated it with explicitness, and we may be prepared to discover
        other coincidences in his new pattern of thought. Even the Epicurean
        doctrine of the indifference of the gods toward the wicked will have its
        analogue.</p>
        <p align="justify">There was no concept of recognition in Jewish
        religious thought. If we scan the Wisdom Literature, especially Psalms
        and Proverbs, where individuality and ethical inwardness in religious
        experience first become plainly manifest, all men, good or bad, are
        individuals in the sight of God. He may look upon the wicked with
        disfavor but he is by no means unaware of their identity. He is
        displeased with them or even angry at them as individuals.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul the innovator had no hesitation in rejecting
        this easy and informal attitude. He institutes a new and specific
        qualification for the divine favor, the profession of faith in the
        resurrected Christ. Mankind is no longer divided into the righteous and
        the wicked, both of them alike being individuals in God's sight; the new
        division is into believers and unbelievers. The former are recognized by
        God and become individuals in his sight; upon the latter God turns his
        back -- they become a nameless multitude without individuality. We find
        Paul's teaching on this question in the first chapter of Romans,
        especially verse 28, of which the translation in the Revised Standard
        leaves much to be desired: &quot;And since they did not see fit to
        acknowledge God, God gave them up to a base mind and to improper
        conduct.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The cardinal error in this translation is to dispense
        with the word <i>recognition;</i> this is technical and will not admit
        of a substitute. It is a mistake also to overlook an idiom of
        characterization over and above the statement of fact; Paul is not only
        stating what these men did but also what kind of men they were. So we
        may tentatively translate: &quot;And since they disapproved of
        vouchsafing recognition to God, God abandoned them to their reprobate
        minds and to go on with their sins.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This doctrine becomes highly astonishing when we
        observe how closely Paul is approaching the position of Epicurus. The
        declaration of the latter that the gods regarded all who were not like
        themselves as &quot;alien&quot; should be recalled. How better could
        this adjective <i>alien</i> be amplified than to say with Paul that
        &quot;God abandoned them to their reprobate minds and to go on with
        their sins&quot;? In other words, the wicked have become to God, as they
        were to the gods of Epicurus, a nameless multitude, with no more
        individuality than sheep.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet this parallelism of doctrine does not stand
        alone. God is no longer ordaining any temporal punishment for
        wickedness. He is thus relieved of his duties as an officer of law
        enforcement, which Epicurus ridiculed as demeaning to the sanctity of
        the divine being. Neither is any punishment for wickedness put in
        prospect for the world to come. Thus Hell is abolished just as it was
        abolished by Epicurus. There is a difference, however; God is still a
        god of wrath and the penalty appointed for the wicked is annihilation at
        the last day.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        The Bid for Recognition</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Now at last it becomes possible to integrate neatly
        the concept of recognition into Paul's new structure of doctrine. This
        concept becomes reciprocal to God's abandonment of unbelievers to their
        reprobate minds and continuance of sin. If God had not assumed this
        attitude, no necessity would have arisen for the individual to make a
        bid for recognition by God.</p>
        <p align="justify">The individual must make the first move. He must
        recognize Jesus as the Son of God in the person of the resurrected
        Christ. This is his bid for recognition by God the Father, who instantly
        reciprocates by recognizing him. At that moment he ceases to be one of a
        multitude devoid of individuality and becomes an individual with a name,
        Dionysius the Areopagite or Lydia the seller of purple or whatever the
        name may be. Thereafter the relationship between him and God is
        personal. The individual becomes a person in the sight of God and God to
        him a person. This is what Paul means by &quot;knowing God&quot; or
        &quot;being known by God.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet even if a higher degree of precision seems to
        have been here achieved, we must not be content. Our understanding will
        be further improved by observing subsidiary aspects of this mutual
        recognition between man and God. To this end we may once more quote
        Galatians 4:9: &quot;now that you have come to know God, or rather to be
        known of God.&quot; These words, while making clear beyond doubt the
        reciprocal nature of the experience, suggest also the inequality of the
        experience. The best that the individual can do is to afford pleasure to
        God but God is capable of making a richer return; he can furnish
        inspiration, guidance, and strength to the believer. It is consequently
        a temptation to emend the translation and read: &quot;now that you have
        come to know God or, <i>better still,</i> to be known by God.&quot; The
        individual enters upon a new life, the life of the Spirit, which is
        eternal.</p>
        <p align="justify">A second inequality in this mutual recognition now
        awaits notice and examination. In the Greek as Paul uses it,
        &quot;knowledge&quot; is <i>gnosis</i> and &quot;recognition&quot; is <i>epignosis.</i>
        With God himself these two words are synonymous. His first recognition
        of the individual is knowledge of the individual; it is perfect from the
        first. This is not true for the individual. His first recognition of God
        is only the beginning of knowledge of God. This knowledge is imperfect,
        even if progressive, and throughout the whole interim of life in the
        flesh will continue to be imperfect. Fullness of knowledge must await a
        final experience of recognition.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        The Final Recognition</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">We are now at last equipped to scrutinize anew and
        interpret and translate the difficult twelfth verse of this thirteenth
        chapter. The words &quot;face to face&quot; remind us definitely that we
        have the phenomenon of recognition to deal with. Only the immediate
        sensation, as Epicurus taught, is true and dependable; the distant views
        fall short of exactitude. A hackneyed example in ancient times was that
        of the square tower, which in the distance appears to be round. Only the
        near view reveals its real shape.</p>
        <p align="justify">When once we have accepted the idea that this way of
        reasoning was commonplace in Paul's time, just as explaining human
        conduct by means of inferiority complexes and other inward compulsions
        is characteristic of the public mind today, we shall better understand
        why he expresses spiritual experiences in terms of sensory experiences.
        He may well have been influenced also by the revelation that came to him
        on the way to Damascus, which was at one and the same time a blinding
        physical experience and an explosive spiritual experience, a genuine
        experience of recognition, the breaking of a new horizon of
        understanding.</p>
        <p align="justify">Perhaps no better way of arriving at the best
        possible degree of precision may be found than by putting the King James
        translation of verse 12 to the test: &quot;Now I know in part; but then
        I shall know even as also I am known.&quot; This wording exhibits the
        deceptive smoothness that constitutes a merit for devotional readings
        but misses utterly the essentials of meaning. Paul is not setting side
        by side two kinds of knowledge but two distinct experiences of
        recognition. His language is virtually technical.</p>
        <p align="justify">First of all, we must have respect for tenses. The
        recognition of the individual by God was a distinct and instantaneous
        event in the past. Therefore, instead of &quot;even as also I am
        known&quot; we should read &quot;even as also I became known.&quot; In
        other words, in the experience of God himself there is no such thing as
        an interim; in his experience the first recognition was perfect from the
        first. In the experience of the individual, on the contrary, the first
        recognition marks the beginning of an interim; this recognition is
        imperfect, even if progressive. Perfection of knowledge must await an
        event in the future, the final recognition, which will be instantaneous,
        like the previous recognition by God, and will terminate the interim.</p>
        <p align="justify">The authors of the Revised Standard have endeavored
        to improve upon the King James but fall into the same inaccuracies:
        &quot;then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully
        understood.&quot; The insertion of the word <i>fully,</i> because it is
        implied in the context, has a certain justification; but even so,
        instead of &quot;even as I have been fully understood&quot; we should
        read &quot;even as I became fully understood,&quot; because God's
        recognition of the individual was an event in the past, single,
        distinct, perfect, and final.</p>
        <p align="justify">The vital defect of both versions, however, is their
        flatness. There is nothing in the wording to suggest the miraculous
        character of the anticipated experience as hinted in Philippians 3:21,
        when the lowly body of the believer will be changed &quot;to be like his
        glorious body&quot;; and still less are we prompted to think of the
        miracle of the victory over death in First Corinthians 15:52, when
        &quot;the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
        incorruptible, and we shall be changed.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul is a man of visions and he cannot but think of
        the religious experience in terms of vivid sensory experiences, vivid
        even to the degree of explosiveness. It is this bent of his mind that
        makes him so partial to the word <i>recognition</i> and the concept
        behind it. He takes this over from the public thought of his day but he
        extends it to meet the necessities of his own structure of doctrine. The
        experience of the resurrection is inevitably prefigured in terms of his
        own explosive experience on the road to Damascus.</p>
        <p align="justify">If we consult the account of that experience in the
        lucid words of the ninth chapter of Acts, we shall find it to begin with
        the words, &quot;and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about
        him.&quot; It was in light that Jesus manifested himself to him. The use
        of the word <i>light</i> is an obsession with Paul. He thinks of the
        gospel, of immortality, of heaven, of Jesus, of God, and of the
        resurrection all in terms of light.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is characteristic of the phenomenon of recognition
        that it comes with a flash. This is true even in so ordinary an
        experience as the recognition of a person, though more noticeably so
        when a person has not been seen for a long time and recognition is
        delayed; at the last it is an instantaneous phenomenon. It is also a
        pleasure.</p>
        <p align="justify">Magnify this experience to the utmost limits of the
        imagination and we shall descry Paul's conception of the believer's
        final recognition of the nature of God as we read it in First
        Corinthians 13:12. It will come with a burst of light, an ecstatic
        transition from imperfect knowledge to perfect knowledge, a dazzling
        visual illumination. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, he will
        come to know God, just as he became known to God.</p>
        <p align="justify">Translation is difficult but the obligation to
        attempt it is mandatory. Paul's ten words are precise, compacted, and
        virtually technical. He does not write: &quot;I shall know even as I was
        known,&quot; but literally, &quot;I shall recognize even as I too was
        recognized.&quot; It is this phenomenon of recognition that cannot be
        ignored, an instantaneous phenomenon. Reluctantly we suggest: &quot;Now
        I know in part, but in that day knowledge will come to me in a flash,
        just as I too became known.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">A last note is due on the phenomenon of recognition.
        No less in literature than in ancient philosophy and psychology it
        played a leading role, especially when the effect was heightened by
        suspense and surprise. In the drama the most gripping of all scenes were
        those in which a concealed identity was revealed at last, as when
        Oedipus was discovered by his own research to have been the murderer of
        his own father. In the whole of the Greek drama, however, no recognition
        scene can be found which for concentrated power of passion and surprise
        is the superior of that described in the unpretentious narrative of
        Luke, Acts 9:1-9, where Paul, prostrate and blinded, hears the words
        from heaven: &quot;I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Here in the brief space of a single paragraph we have
        before us in unique combination the highest essentials of the tragic
        drama and no less the kindred religious experience of spiritual
        discovery and illumination.

        </font></b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="4">I</font><font size="2">T STILL</font> remains for us to
        scrutinize some evidences of Paul's knowledge of Epicureanism which do
        not fall within the scope of particular Epistles. By way of preparation
        for this scrutiny, however, it will be well for us to cast a sweeping
        glance at the factors of history and geography, subscribing for the
        moment to the view of Epicurus that all events are &quot;accidents of
        time, place, and persons.&quot; We shall also better our understanding
        by recognizing to what extent the success of Paul's ministries depended
        upon the high level of education which was prevailing during his time.</p>
        <p align="justify">The first phenomenon that calls for our attention is
        the vast shifts of population that took place in the three centuries
        that intervened between the lifetime of Epicurus and that of Paul. It
        was an era of great migrations.</p>
        <p align="justify">The first migration was that of Greeks into the East
        to build and populate the hundreds of new cities founded by Alexander
        the Great and his successors. This exploitation was accomplished with
        astonishing speed, only to be followed quickly by the political
        confusion that regularly characterized Greek affairs. It was this
        confusion that provoked and justified conquest by the steadier genius of
        Rome. After this conquest a contrary movement of population set in
        toward the West and to Italy in particular.</p>
        <p align="justify">Both of these migrations were accompanied by the
        philosophy of Epicurus. It was already flourishing, for example, in
        Tarsus and Antioch in the second century B.C. but did not flourish in
        Rome until the following century in the lifetime of Julius Caesar and
        Cicero.</p>
        <p align="justify">Corresponding to these mass migrations of Greeks
        there were mass migrations of Jews in the opposite direction. A
        replacement of populations was taking place. As the Greeks swarmed
        eastward into the Near East and beyond, the Jews began to move northward
        and westward into Asia Minor, Macedonia, and the mainland of Greece.
        These migrations of Jews, the so-called Diaspora, were followed in their
        turn by Christianity.</p>
        <p align="justify">The pattern of all these movements, both the
        migrations that preceded and the cultural changes that followed in their
        wakes, is typified in the person and activities of Paul. He was a Jew by
        birth, by early education an Epicurean, and by conversion a Christian.
        He began his ministry in Syria and Cilicia, spent the greater part of
        his life among the mixed populations of Jews and Greeks in Asia Minor,
        Macedonia, and the mainland of Greece, and last of all arrived in Rome,
        the ultimate goal and limit of the influences of the East.</p>

        <p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        <font face="Arial">Philosophy, Religion, and Education</font></font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">So much for migrations and countermigrations and
        their cultural sequels. The second requisite for gaining the synoptic
        view of events is to observe to what extent these cultural sequels
        depended upon the existence of a literate public.</p>
        <p align="justify">The philosophy of Epicurus depended to a special
        degree upon the literacy of Greek and other populations. Its creed was
        embodied from the first in handy textbooks, compiled with a special view
        to home study and group study. Its appeal was not to princes and the
        friends of princes, as in the case of Platonism, but rather to the
        intelligent and educated middle class. Its method of extension was from
        friend to friend. Each disciple delighted to carry the handbooks of
        Epicurus in his wallet and pass them to others for reading. Moreover,
        these textbooks were graded in such a way as to encourage more and more
        reading. Once begun, the course of study was believed to result in a
        sequence of revelation.</p>
        <p align="justify">The student was encouraged to be self-dependent in
        his reading; he was compared to a hound that had been set upon the
        trail: &quot;Thus by your own efforts you will be able to spot one clue
        after another, work your way into all the dark recesses, and drag forth
        the truth to light.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Pauline Christianity, of course, was equally
        dependent upon the existence of a literate public. Paul was not
        following the example of Jesus, who wrote nothing, shunned the cities,
        sought out the lost sheep in byways, villages, and mountains, and spoke
        in parables. Paul, a product of urban life and education, heads
        invariably for the towns and cities, and most of his Epistles are
        specifically addressed to the inhabitants of cities.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is possible to say more: Paul's public was not
        only intelligent and literate; it was well-to-do, and this was
        especially true of the Philippians. For instance, he writes in Second
        Corinthians 11:9: &quot;During my sojourn with you, when I ran short, I
        did not sponge on anyone, because the friends who had come from
        Macedonia made up my deficiency and more.&quot; Again in Philippians
        4:14-19 we find him embarrassed by the generosity of that church. This
        generosity occasioned him another kind of embarrassment, because it gave
        to some the excuse for accusing him of using his apostleship for gain,
        against which he defends himself by boasting of his sufferings. It was
        the same calumny of jealous rivals that caused him to make a point of
        working with his hands.</p>
        <p align="justify">The vast difference between the cultural level of
        those to whom Paul addressed himself and that of those classes sought
        out by other preachers is vividly presented by a testimony of the
        churchman Origen, who quotes a hostile critic. This critic accuses the
        Christians of putting a discount upon education.</p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;Otherwise,&quot; he demands to know, &quot;why
        is it a demerit to have received an education and to be intelligent and
        to be thought so? Why should this disqualify one from arriving at a
        knowledge of God? Why should it not rather be a prerequisite and
        something by virtue of which a man might better arrive at a grasp of the
        truth? But what we actually see is this, that those who collect an
        audience and ventilate the wildest ideas in the market places will never
        go near a group of intelligent men nor drum up their courage to air
        their doctrines in the presence of such; but whenever they espy some
        teen-age lads or a bevy of household slaves or a throng of empty-headed
        individuals, there the push their way in and strut their stuff.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Whatever discount we may place upon this diatribe, it
        still may be useful in compelling us to realize how superior was the
        intelligence and education of those to whom Paul addressed himself. In
        First Corinthians 3:2 he chided his readers for being &quot;babes in
        Christ.&quot; fit to be fed with milk and not solid food, but in the
        very chapter of this Epistle he assumed that these readers would
        understand his irony in dubbing the atoms of Epicurus &quot;the things
        that are&quot; and spiritual realities &quot;the things that are
        not.&quot; In the second chapter of this same Epistle he assumes that
        his readers understand the meaning of a criterion of truth; and he sets
        up a new criterion, paying those readers the high compliment of
        employing language fit to be tested by the precision gauge of logic:
        &quot;The spiritual man judges all things, but is himself to be judged
        by no one.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul further presumes upon the intelligence and
        education of his readers by the drastic condensation of argument. He
        seems to have shared the fear of verbosity with Epicurus, one of whose
        warnings runs: &quot;We must realize that the long discourse and the
        short discourse aim at the same objective.&quot; Paul's addiction to the
        short discourse may even seem to have been carried to extremes. For
        instance, when he writes that &quot;the spiritual man judges all
        things,&quot; he may seem to claim too much. Certainly he would not have
        us believe that spiritual insight is a judge of colors, nor that it
        operates on the sensory level at all, nor even on the rational level of
        thought. What he really did mean is stated with curt exactitude in verse
        11: &quot;For what person knows a man's thoughts except the spirit of
        the man which is in him? So also no one understands the thoughts of God
        except the Spirit of God.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The validity of the new criterion is confined to a
        definite level of experience; it is an insight into human personality
        and the nature of God.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        On the Nature of Things</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">There is still more to be gleaned, however, from
        Paul's assumptions. These not only enlighten us upon the high degree of
        intelligence and education which he presumed in his readers, but also
        inform us of the extent of his own knowledge of Epicureanism.</p>
        <p align="justify">One of the first writings of Epicurus was an
        encyclopedic work in thirty-seven rolls entitled <i>On the Nature of
        Things</i>. This would have made a volume of perhaps fifteen hundred
        pages if printed in the type and format of the Revised Standard New
        Testament. It was speedily supplemented by what came to be called the
        Big Epitome, in seven rolls, which would make a book of half the size of
        the Revised Standard New Testament. This Epitome was supplemented in
        turn by a Little Epitome, which is still extant as a letter addressed to
        Herodotus. It runs to twenty-five pages of text.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus we have the titles of three writings of Epicurus
        covering the same ground but we are able to identify the level of
        knowledge presumed by Paul in his readers as corresponding to the Big
        Epitome. We are able to infer this because we know that Epicurus set up
        three criteria of truth, Sensations, Feelings, and Anticipations, and of
        these only the Sensations find mention in Paul's Epistles, as in
        Colossians 2:18: &quot;taking his stand on what he has seen, puffed up
        without justification by the mind of the flesh.&quot; This is precisely
        what we find in the poem of the Roman poet Lucretius, who reproduced in
        Latin the Big Epitome; he dwells upon the Sensations as criteria but
        offers no exposition of the other two. There is another item of evidence
        pointing in the same direction. When Paul in the verse quoted above
        speaks of &quot;the mind of the flesh,&quot; this refers plainly to the
        doctrine of Epicurus that the mind is an organ of the body no less than
        the eyes or the ears, which is emphasized by Lucretius while not
        explicitly stated in the Little Epitome.</p>
        <p align="justify">Neither the Big nor the Little Epitome of Epicurus
        deals specifically with the subject of ethics but they make it
        abundantly clear that the source of ethical principles is to be found in
        the physical principles. In other words, Nature is the supreme teacher.
        Paul reveals his awareness of this doctrine by the vehemence with which
        he asserts the substitute doctrine that &quot;all the treasures of
        wisdom and knowledge&quot; are hidden in God. Yet his youthful
        allegiance to the creed of Epicurus so far prevails over the convictions
        of his mature age that he finds it quite easy to write &quot;according
        to nature&quot; and &quot;contrary to nature&quot; and in First
        Corinthians 11:14 actually recognizes the principle he elsewhere
        repudiates: &quot;Does not Nature herself teach you?&quot; This
        phraseology is foreign to the New Testament except in his Epistles. In
        spite of himself he shares the Epicurean slant of the public mind of the
        time.</p>
        <p align="justify">There is one doctrine, however, in respect of which
        Paul is never off his guard, the teaching that pleasure is the end or
        the goal of living and sanctioned by Nature as such. The roll in which
        this doctrine was expounded bore the title <i>On the End</i> and its
        celebrity was unsurpassed, because it was beloved by disciples and
        abhorred by enemies. This abhorrence is shared by Paul, in spite of the
        fact that he must have known the innocence of the word <i>pleasure</i>
        as employed by Epicurus, who wrote: &quot;Whenever we say pleasure is
        the end, we do not mean the pleasures of profligates and those pleasures
        that consist in self-indulgence, but the absence of pain in the body and
        of turmoil in the soul.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In Paul's thinking the mere mention of the word <i>pleasure</i>
        is hazardous and he studiously avoids it, using it but once and then in
        an evil sense, Titus 3:3. The studious avoidance, however, reveals his
        awareness of the dangerous ambiguity of the doctrine for which the word
        stood. His silence points to his fears; no compromise with pleasure was
        conceivable.</p>
        <p align="justify">The second ethical writing of Epicurus that ranked as
        a classic was entitled <i>On Choices and Avoidances</i> but for Paul
        this seems to have been superseded by the later work of Philodemus of
        Gadara entitled <i>On Vices and the Corresponding Virtues</i>, several
        times cited in previous chapters. The influence of this treatise is
        ubiquitous in Paul's writing, sometimes as an effective device of style,
        as in First Corinthians 13, but more often, as with the Epicureans, a
        device of instruction, especially in Galatians 5:19-24, where &quot;the
        works of the flesh&quot; are summed up in a prodigious list of vices as
        opposed to &quot;the fruit of the Spirit.&quot; Similar lists have been
        called to attention in Colossians 3:1-8, where earthly things are set in
        opposition to &quot;things that are above.&quot; The appeal of this
        device to the modern mind is attested by the popularity of these
        passages as devotional readings.</p>
        <p align="justify">Other devotional readings that find favor with modern
        congregations and can be traced to an Epicurean source may be found in.
        Philippians 4. and First Timothy 6. In both of these the theme is
        contentment with little and Paul reveals the origin of his thought by
        employing Greek words, <i>autarkes</i> and <i>autarkeia,</i> which are
        shared with Epicurus and occur only in the Epistles. In this letter to
        Timothy, Paul writes: &quot;for we brought nothing into the world and we
        cannot take anything out of it.&quot; Epicurus before him had written:
        &quot;Every man takes leave of life just as he was at the moment of
        birth.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The same sentiments that endeared the name of
        Epicurus to multitudes of men in the ancient world have endeared the
        name of Paul to multitudes of Bible readers in our own times.</p>
        <p align="justify">Concerning the topic of contentment with little we
        are informed by Cicero &quot;that no one had more to say about it than
        Epicurus.&quot; He must have discussed it in various writings but all
        that is left to us, beyond some isolated sayings, is the charming letter
        to the lad Menoeceus, which his ancient biographer chose for quotation
        out of more than three hundred rolls. Other affiliations of this letter
        with Paul's Epistle to Timothy have been mentioned elsewhere in this
        study, but here it is worth repeating that both letters associate
        contentment with little with reverence for the divine being and in the
        letter of Epicurus we find the exhortation that Paul expresses in an
        identical context of thought in Philippians 4:8: &quot;think on these
        things.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">We shall also gain something by observing that this
        letter of Epicurus to Menoeceus deserves to rank as the most fascinating
        specimen extant of the kind of writing known to the Greeks as <i>protreptic</i>,
        that is, exhortation to the study of philosophy as the Greeks as <i>protreptic</i>,
        that style of writing, it is needless to say, was indispensable to
        Christianity as a missionary creed, and Paul alone among the apostles
        possessed the necessary training for it. All the change that was needed
        was transposition of his tone to another key, which Paul was amply
        qualified to make. The <i>protreptic</i> or hortatory tone pervades all
        his writings and it is expressly designated in this Epistle to Timothy,
        6:2: &quot;These things teach and exhort,&quot; as it reads in the King
        James Version.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus we observe an attitude, a complex of ideas, and
        even a terminology that is common to Paul with Epicurus. Each item of
        this common store, taken by itself, may be discounted as a mere
        possibility, but the sum of mere possibilities can add up to certainty.</p>

        Authorized Doctrines</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The forty Authorized Doctrines of Epicurus
        constituted the most notorious brief piece of writing in ancient times.
        Scholars have translated the title in a variety of ways, such as
        Principal Doctrines, Sovran Maxims, and the like. In this study they are
        called Authorized Doctrines, partly for the reason that the shrewd
        judgment of Cicero so appraised them, but chiefly for the reason that
        the author encouraged his disciples to commit them to memory.</p>
        <p align="justify">They have been compared to a catechism but more
        precisely may be designated Articles of Faith. They represent a stage in
        the development of doctrine which Epicureanism reached as early as 300
        B.C., while Christianity was only beginning to arrive at a like stage
        after 300 A.D. As so often, Epicurus, the pathfinder, had set a
        precedent.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Doctrines add up to a mere five pages of print
        and may easily be perused in twenty minutes; in the form of a roll the
        bulk would not have exceeded that of a small fountain pen. They were
        read by friend and foe, by the one for memorization and fond and
        thoughtful pondering, by the other for derision and refutation. By
        either standard Paul would have qualified, as a friend in the years of
        his impulsive adolescence, as a foe in his ardent and consecrated
        maturity.</p>
        <p align="justify">Of this notorious collection by far the most
        notorious were the first four, which declared the master's teachings on
        the four essentials of the faith: the gods, death, pleasure, and pain.
        The accident that the number of these was four, combined with the claim
        of Epicurus to be a healer of souls, prompted some ribald critics to dub
        them derisively the Tetrapharmacon, which happened to be the name of a
        popular household remedy compounded of four ingredients: beeswax, resin,
        pitch, and honey. The name may be rendered Four-in-One but the derisive
        effect is-better reproduced if we say Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup.</p>
        <p align="justify">Public ridicule, we need not argue, is a tribute to
        public fame, and our immediate interest in this derided recipe for
        happiness, the Tetrapharmacon, is to cite it as evidence of what was in
        the public mind in the time of Paul. If the topics of the gods, death,
        pleasure, and pain were among the foremost in the public mind, then they
        were among the foremost in the mind of Paul.</p>
        <p align="justify">All four of these Authorized Doctrines were highly
        disturbing to orthodoxy in all its guises. Epicurus may be compared with
        Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud in his extraordinary knack for
        disturbing the public mind. The first Doctrine may have been chosen to
        head the collection for this very quality. It declares the principle
        that the divine being is happy itself and makes no business of
        dispensing troubles to other creatures, that it is not a weak thing and
        so is not given to anger. This criticism was especially stinging, first
        to Jews and later to Christians, and had much to do with transforming
        the God of wrath into the God of love, in which Paul played the foremost
        role. Although it cannot be claimed that Paul originated the
        transformation, it is a fact that he rationalized it.</p>
        <p align="justify">As for the three remaining topics, that of pain has
        been touched upon in the chapter on Faith, Hope, and Love under the
        heading of Hope and Health. It will appear again at the end of the
        present chapter under the heading of Alpha and Omega. The topic of
        pleasure has been discussed in the chapter on Philippians, while that of
        death and immortality has been dealt with in the chapter on The Logic of
        the Cross. As further evidence of Paul's knowledge of the Authorized
        Doctrines we may consequently turn to the topic of expediency.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><font size="4" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="3">Expediency</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The term <i>expedient,</i> to which the King James
        Version is partial, has been avoided by the Revised Standard, manifestly
        for the reason of its having accumulated a load of sinister suggestion,
        tending to connote the gaining of personal advantage at the expense of
        another. Both Epicurus and Paul, however, employ the Greek equivalent
        without scruple or hesitation and for both of them the term denotes the
        advantage either of the first person or of others. This terminology is
        virtually technical and admits of no substitution so long as precision
        of interpretation is the objective, as in the present inquiry. We are
        consequently calling the topic &quot;expediency.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Two of the chief topics of the Authorized Doctrines
        are pleasure and justice, concerning which Epicurus makes identical
        statements: &quot;No pleasure is evil in itself,&quot; and &quot;To act
        unjustly is not an evil in itself.&quot; This means that the evil of an
        action lies solely in the consequences and that the test in either
        instance is expediency. How this will operate in practice is made clear
        from a saying of Epicurus taken from another collection: &quot;To all
        our desires must be applied this question: What will be the result for
        me if the object of this desire is attained and what if it is not?&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This presumes that the individual is completely at
        liberty to choose the one or the other and Paul makes this presumption
        explicit, First Corinthians 6:12: &quot;All things are lawful for
        me.&quot; This rendering, however, is not merely imprecise; it is
        incorrect. For example, a man is at liberty to steal but this would not
        be lawful. The meaning is rather: &quot;There is nothing I am not at
        liberty to do.&quot; The principle that Paul asserts is that of free
        will in man, which Epicurus was the first Greek philosopher to exalt to
        the eminence of a doctrine. The two men have this in common.</p>
        <p align="justify">Let us now shift our attention to 10:23 of this same
        Epistle, where the same principle is twice repeated, &quot;All things
        are lawful,&quot; meaning that the choice between doing or not doing a
        given thing is always open. The problem in this instance is the eating
        of meat sacrificed to idols. Such action, Paul would have us believe, in
        and by itself is quite neutral, neither good nor bad, but, if it causes
        another to stumble, the factor of evil arises. This evil lies in the
        consequence, just as Epicurus taught. The test is expediency, which in
        this case is not selfish but altruistic, consideration for the good of
        another.</p>
        <p align="justify">Let us now return our attention to the first passage,
        6:13, where the problem is that of sexual purity. This is prefaced by
        the same principle, &quot;All things are lawful,&quot; but the test
        applied in this instance is not expediency; it is given a spiritual
        guise: &quot;Do you not know that your bodies are members of
        Christ?&quot; This theme is amplified with Paul's usual adeptness and
        may be summed up in the statement that the body is &quot;a temple of the
        Holy Spirit.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In respect of this teaching we are singularly
        fortunate, because we possess also the teaching of Epicurus worked out
        in exceptional detail on the principle of expediency. That this teaching
        in turn had the rank of a classic is evidenced by its inclusion in a
        collection of Epicurean aphorisms, which, by the way, came to light so
        recently as 1888 in the Vatican Library. Yet this is not the whole
        story; additional testimony to the vogue of the teaching in antiquity is
        a blistering attack upon it by Cicero in a public speech. And if he,
        speaking far away from Greece in the Roman Forum, was able to count upon
        an understanding response from jury and spectators to such a blast of
        satire, may we not with comfortable certainty feel assured that Paul,
        who in his impressionable youth had been captivated by the siren voices
        of Epicurus and who was spending his life among the Greeks, was equally
        familiar with this particular teaching? May we not even infer that he
        was feeling a challenge to refuse to judge this major offense of
        impurity by the cold test of expediency and was resolved to institute a
        new and more fitting test on the higher level of spiritual law?</p>
        <p align="justify">The teaching of Epicurus has been excerpted from a
        letter to a correspondent who confessed a proneness to the pleasures of
        the flesh: &quot;Young man, whenever you are not breaking the laws of
        the land, nor violating the code of honor sanctioned by good society,
        nor inflicting wrong upon some neighbor, nor ruining your health, nor
        squandering your substance, follow your own inclinations just as you
        please; it is impossible, however, not to become involved in at least
        one of these offenses, because sexual indulgence never did any good and
        it is lucky when it does no harm.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">That these words were thought worthy to be excerpted
        and to be enshrined in a collection of aphorisms need not surprise us.
        They represent the reasoning by expediency at its best, whether it be
        selfish or altruistic. Epicurus discerns each aspect of the offense:
        against the state, against society, against the individual neighbor,
        against health, and against thrift. Paul tacitly brushes them all aside
        and substitutes a single one, the offense against the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p align="justify">It would be undue haste, however, to dismiss the
        topic at this point; a last scrutiny will be rewarding. We should not,
        for instance, slip into the error of supposing that motives of
        expediency are deprived of validity by Paul's substitution of the
        spiritual sanction. The crux of the question lies in this, that
        expediency as a motive can never become a satisfactory front for a code
        of morality. It can never be a cause for pride, unless for an obstinate
        man such as Epicurus, who dedicated himself to the practice of total
        honesty. This resoluteness is commendable but it was a chief factor in
        condemning him to obloquy in the tradition of learning.</p>
        <p align="justify">Thus expediency as a motive falls into the same class
        with pleasure as the objective of living; both call for incessant
        defense and apology. The Stoics chose more prudently, if less
        courageously. They cherished only such watchwords as called for no
        apology: virtue, duty, reason, and divine providence. Thus they have
        fared better than they merited in the tradition of learning; they
        catered to the unconscious vanity of mankind.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul himself is quite capable of putting the
        spiritual and the expedient on the same level. In Ephesians 6:1 he
        writes: &quot;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is
        right.&quot; In the very next verse he writes: &quot;Honor your father
        and your mother&quot; (such is the first commandment with a promise),
        &quot;that it may be well with you and that you may live long upon the
        earth.&quot; The reward here offered for honor to parents is sheer
        expediency, selfish advantage.</p>
        <p align="justify">When Paul quoted the first commandment, it was the
        orthodox Jew that spoke. When he wrote, &quot;obey your parents in the
        Lord,&quot; it was the regenerate Paul. When he wrote, &quot;All things
        are lawful,&quot; asserting his liberty of choice, it was the
        ex-Epicurean who spoke. At times it was difficult for him to keep his
        various personalities in coordination. His mentality operates on the
        border line between philosophy and religion.</p>

        False Opinions</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Paul's knowledge of the Authorized Doctrines is
        evidenced also by the use of the word <i>kenodoxia,</i> which no other
        writer in the New Testament employs. Mention of this has already been
        made in the discussion of Galatians 5:26, but some amplification is
        desirable. The lexicographers and translators have been merely guessing
        at the meaning of the word. It does not mean &quot;conceit&quot; or
        &quot;self-conceit.&quot; It does not occur in classical Greek and may
        well have been a coinage of Epicurus. For him it denotes a &quot;false
        opinion,&quot; and what we call an illusion; for example, the idea that
        rich people are happy. We cannot acquire a clear understanding of it
        unless we become acquainted with a certain way of reasoning, which
        originated with Epicurus and was familiar to both Paul and his readers.</p>
        <p align="justify">This peculiar line of reasoning runs after this
        fashion. Epicurus thought of the human mind as functioning in two ways:
        either automatically and unconsciously or consciously and volitionally.
        For example, it is the automatic mind that takes care of us on our daily
        rounds, keeping us from tripping over the curb or falling into
        excavations. This mind, however, is very prone to error. For instance,
        to quote an ancient example, the boat upon which we are passengers may
        seem to be in motion and the adjacent boat to be standing still, while
        the opposite is true. It is the automatic mind that commits the error,
        which is corrected by the conscious or volitional mind.</p>
        <p align="justify">A similar type of error is discerned on the ethical
        level; human beings carelessly allow the flesh to do their thinking for
        them. To illustrate, in Authorized Doctrine 20 Epicurus writes: &quot;It
        is the flesh that finds the limits of pleasure to be infinite.&quot; The
        rational mind knows better; it knows that a natural ceiling has been set
        to the pleasure of eating, that is, the satisfaction of hunger. Again,
        in Doctrine 30, speaking of hunger and thirst, Epicurus makes the point
        that the urge to gratify them may be intense but the idea that any real
        distress will follow if they are not gratified is a &quot;false
        opinion.&quot; The rational mind knows better; the automatic, irrational
        mind has allowed the flesh to make a decision for it. This is a context
        in which we find the singular term <i>kenodoxia</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify">Out of this line of reasoning inaugurated by Epicurus
        arose the antithesis of the flesh to the mind, which preceded the
        antithesis of the flesh to the Spirit. Paul exhibits undoubtable
        evidence of his familiarity with the previous phase of the idea,
        especially in Romans 7:13-25, where he elaborates it. The last verse
        states this explicitly: &quot;I of myself serve the law of God with my <i>mind,</i>
        but with my <i>flesh</i> I serve the law of sin.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In this passage we recognize a stage in the growth of
        this figure of thought that stands midway between philosophy and
        religion. The opposition of the flesh to the mind has been unmistakably
        taken over from philosophy while the concepts of law and sin had their
        origin in Judaism. The subsequent stage is to be observed in Galatians
        5:17: &quot;For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the
        desires of the Spirit are against the flesh.&quot; The final phase
        exhibits itself in First Corinthians 2, where the judgments of the mind
        with its diligent calculus of advantage have been completely superseded
        by the verdicts of the Spirit, which &quot;judges all things.&quot;</p>

        <font size="3">The Deceitfulness of Riches</font></font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">The affinity of Paul's teachings to those of Epicurus
        will become still more clear for us if we glance at the topics of fame,
        power, and riches, especially the last. Those people who thoughtlessly
        allow their feelings to make their decisions for them are prone to
        believe that the famous, the powerful, and the rich are happy. These are
        &quot;false opinions&quot; in the exact sense that Epicurus used that
        phrase and he campaigned against them just as Jesus and Paul did
        afterward.</p>
        <p align="justify">This topic goes more properly with the Gospels, where
        the material is more abundant, but Paul specifically deals with what is
        rightly translated in the King James Version &quot;the deceitfulness of
        riches&quot; and wrongly changed in the Revised Standard to &quot;the
        delight in riches.&quot; Moreover, both his ideology and his terminology
        reveal unmistakable recollections of known sayings of Epicurus. For
        instance, the latter writes: &quot;No man looks on evil and deliberately
        chooses it; but, baited by something that seems good in comparison with
        an evil greater than itself, he gets trapped.&quot; Alongside of this
        let us place Paul's words in the context already cited, First Timothy
        6:9: &quot;But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a
        trap,&quot; and so on.</p>
        <p align="justify">Yet there is a point to be added from the side of
        terminology. Epicurus writes: &quot;Human nature is not to be coerced
        but persuaded, and we shall persuade it by satisfying the necessary
        desires and the natural desires also, provided only they do not injure
        us, but relentlessly rejecting the injurious.&quot; Paul in the verses
        quoted in part above goes on to say that those who desire to be rich
        &quot;fall a prey to many irrational and injurious desires.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">In this passage the &quot;irrational desires&quot;
        are the &quot;false opinions&quot; of Epicurus, dictated by the feelings
        and not checked by reason. As for &quot;injurious desires,&quot; the
        Greek word for &quot;injurious&quot; is here a solitary occurrence in
        the New Testament and a favorite of Epicurus.</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
        Creation and Civilization</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">Another topic that we know to have been expounded in
        the Big Epitome was the creation of the world, and Paul's knowledge of
        this exposition may readily be certified.</p>
        <p align="justify">At the outset we should not be surprised to learn
        that the topic was treated by Epicurus with his customary ridicule; it
        seemed absurd to him to believe that an earth so abounding in
        uninhabitable wastes of water and mountains, torrid deserts, and regions
        rigid with cold should have been the creation of a benevolent and
        all-wise being. He scoffed at the idea that man had been given dominion
        over the beasts of the field; the world had no more been made for the
        sake of man than for the sake of insects. Civilization, in his view of
        things, was the aggregate of the cumulative experience of mankind; all
        the supremacy enjoyed by man was the fruit of his own labors and pains.
        In a universe governed by natural laws man alone was an intelligent
        creature and endowed with freedom of the will.</p>
        <p align="justify">We also know that the Epicurean procedure in breaking
        down the beliefs of religion was to ask bantering questions and we
        possess enough evidence to reconstruct their attacks upon the Book of
        Genesis. A trivial example from the record may give us a lead: if the
        sun and the moon were not created until the fourth day, what is the
        sense of saying &quot;that the evening and the morning were the first
        day&quot;?</p>
        <p align="justify">A more important query, however, must claim our
        attention. Epicurus had attached much importance to the study of
        infinity and one aspect of this was the problem of time. This study
        resulted in certain acute reasonings, which were employed by later
        disciples to embarrass Jews and Christians. These reasonings, as was
        usual, were cast in the form of bantering questions. For example, they
        demanded to know: &quot;What was God doing before he created the heaven
        and earth?&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Even three centuries after Paul's time this question
        remained so vexatious that St. Augustine dealt with it at great length
        in his <i>Confessions</i> 11:10-31.</p>
        <p align="justify">Especially vexatious was the implication that God had
        experienced a change of mind. Recognition of this fact is the key to the
        interpretation of a clause in James 1:17: &quot;with whom is no
        variableness, neither shadow of turning.&quot; On this point there is
        regrettable fumbling in the Revised Standard: &quot;with whom there is
        no variation or <i>shadow due to change</i>.&quot; The meaning is clear:
        with God there is no changing or possibility of changing, neither in the
        past nor in the future; he was not changing his mind when he became the
        creator nor will he go back on his promise to glorify mankind. As Paul
        writes in Hebrews 10:23, &quot;for he who promised is faithful.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">With a bit more precision the words of James 1:17 may
        be rendered: &quot;with whom is no changing or glimmer of
        defaulting.&quot; God will not default on his promise.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul, unlike St. Augustine, had no time for
        argumentation. He retorts to his unnamed questioners dogmatically and
        declares, in effect, that God had never suffered a change of mind; on
        the contrary, the exaltation of mankind had been his intention before
        time began. This retort may be read in First Corinthians 2:7: &quot;But
        we tell you of wisdom in the form of a mystery revealed, the wisdom that
        had been hidden, which God preordained in advance of the ages for our
        glorification.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">At this point we should pause to observe that this
        wisdom which was &quot;preordained in advance of the ages&quot; is
        divine providence, but the word providence is never employed by Paul; in
        the whole New Testament it occurs but twice and in neither instance has
        reference to God. In Paul's concept of things the wisdom of God and the
        providence of God are synonymous and identical; they are inseparable
        ideas, inseparable in the same sense that God and the love of God are
        inseparable.</p>
        <p align="justify">Incidentally, Paul, like Epicurus before him, is
        addicted to this notion of inseparable ideas. It may be recalled that
        Epicurus in the fifth of his Authorized Doctrines insisted upon the
        inseparability of the virtuous life and the happy life. In his ethic
        they could no more be separated than heat could be separated from fire,
        whiteness from snow, or sweetness from honey.</p>
        <p align="justify">It is because of this neat and tidy principle that
        Paul feels no need to have a separate word for the providence of God.
        For the very reason that the wisdom of God is &quot;preordained in
        advance of the ages&quot; it is a blueprint for all future events. Even
        the course of history and civilization is predetermined. Paul literally
        believed that the Roman Empire was part of the divine plan; otherwise he
        could not have written, as he does in Romans 13:1: &quot;The powers that
        be are ordained of God.&quot; Creation and history are inseparable parts
        of a single plan. Paul not only held that God had created mankind; he
        also believed that God had mapped off the earth, assigned territory to
        each race, and determined the length of its tenure, the very dates of
        history. The supporting text is in Acts 17:26: &quot;And he created from
        a single beginning every race of men to dwell upon the face of the
        earth, having fixed the times appointed for them and the bounds of their
        habitation.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">These words were uttered in the hall of the Court of
        the Areopagus in Athens and, when Paul uttered them, there can be little
        doubt that his gaze was directed straight into the faces of the mocking
        Epicurean philosophers, who in the market place previously had asked:
        &quot;What would this babbler say?&quot; Unless his concept of history
        had been babble to these &quot;mockers,&quot; Paul would never have
        thrown this pronouncement into their faces so defiantly. As for these
        men who were being defied, they had learned from the master that the
        Trojan war, for example, was &quot;an accident of time, place, and
        persons,&quot; that history was the struggle for existence, and
        civilization the evolution of the unintended.</p>
        <p align="justify">Paul, however, could also cast a dart of ridicule. To
        him this Epicurean view of the nature of things was &quot;the wisdom of
        men,&quot; fit only for &quot;children,&quot; that is, in his
        vocabulary, adolescents. The logic of opposites applies here; in First
        Corinthians 2:6 we read: &quot;We tell of wisdom in an audience of
        adults.&quot;</p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<br>
        Alpha and Omega</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">A fitting topic for the conclusion of this survey
        will be the symbolism of alpha and omega, which is familiar to us in its
        most elaborated form, Revelation 22:13: &quot;I am the Alpha and the
        Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">It is somewhat astonishing to discover what a
        diversity of meanings can be ascribed by learned men to these seemingly
        simple words. In reality the trail of the truth is easy to follow,
        provided only the proper clue has once been spotted. This trail leads
        first to Paul and then to Epicurus. The Pauline reference occurs in
        Hebrews 12:2, where a certain degree of hesitation is exhibited in the
        translations. The King James reads: &quot;looking unto Jesus, the author
        and finisher of our faith,&quot; while the Revised Standard essays to
        improve by reading: &quot;the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Both of these versions have the defect of diverting
        the attention to unessential features of the idea and away from the
        essentials. The core of the meaning may be summed up in the statement
        that the plan of salvation has its beginning and its end in Jesus the
        Christ. In order to apprehend this with clearness we must keep in mind
        the concept of the interim, of which the prior limit was the crucifixion
        and resurrection of Jesus and the later limit was to be the second
        coming and the general resurrection.</p>
        <p align="justify">In these two events the active agent was Jesus the
        Christ, delegated to the task by God the Father. The crucifixion was a
        voluntary sacrifice and at the event of the second coming the Son will
        voluntarily restore to the Father the special powers which had been
        delegated to him, as we read in First Corinthians 15:24. Thus Christ is
        &quot;the beginner and the finisher of our faith.&quot; The mistake
        against which we must be on guard is to assume that <i>faith</i>
        signifies the Christian religion; this is the error that leads our
        recent translators to write: &quot;the pioneer and perfecter of our <i>faith.&quot;</i>
        To Paul the word faith signifies the virtue of the interim, which begins
        with the first coming and will definitely end with the second coming. By
        this event the faith of the believer will have been justified and
        terminated.</p>
        <p align="justify">The trail leads next to Epicurus and our discovery
        may be startling at the same time that it adds precision to our
        understanding. In the charming but provocative letter to Menoeceus,
        which Paul manifestly knew, we find a statement from the pen of
        Epicurus: &quot;Pleasure is the beginning and the end of the happy
        life.&quot; To condense the whole meaning of this saying to a single
        sentence or even a single paragraph would be impossible, but the gist of
        it may be briefly paraphrased. Epicurus conceived of human life as an
        interim of consciousness bounded by birth and death. The first act of
        the newborn child is to reach out for food, which is a form of pleasure.
        His last act, providing that he has lived a life of wisdom, is to take
        leave of life with a joyous paean of victory over death, which is also
        pleasure.</p>
        <p align="justify">The next step in our reasoning will be to invoke the
        logic of opposites. When John writes in Revelation, &quot;I am the
        beginning and the end,&quot; he is tacitly repudiating the rival
        doctrine, which multitudes knew by heart: &quot;Pleasure is the
        beginning and the end of the happy life.&quot; With a critical glance at
        the Greek original it is even possible to improve the translation and
        arrive at a proper emphasis: &quot;It is I who am the beginning and the
        end,&quot; inviting the informed reader to add, &quot;and not
        pleasure.&quot; We modern readers fail to do this, because the dictum of
        Epicurus is no longer part of the public mind.</p>
        <p align="justify">The correctness of this interpretation is confirmed
        by a detail that may readily be overlooked as lacking particular
        significance. In close context with the above verse of John in
        Revelation 22:13 we read that the saints shall enter the City of God by
        the gates but &quot;without are the dogs, the poisoners, the
        fornicators,&quot; and so on. These dogs are not the animals of the
        streets, which would be pointless, but Epicureans, who by declaring
        &quot;that pleasure is the beginning and the end of the happy
        life,&quot; had brought man down to the level of the beasts. The
        recourse to this gibe is not singular in this passage. We should recall
        that Paul in Philippians 3:2 had issued the warning, &quot;Beware of the
        dogs,&quot; and in verse 19 made clear the reference to the Epicureans
        by the words: &quot;Their god is the belly and they glory in their
        shame.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">For Epicurus it was of no avail that he practiced
        asceticism and restricted the scope of pleasure to the satisfaction of
        natural and necessary desires. The very name of pleasure meant damnation
        for him in the eyes of those who feared his doctrines and hated his
        popularity. To the Christians he was Antichrist.</p>
        <p align="justify">To return now to Paul, despite the fact that the name
        of pleasure was repellent to him, the tidy reasonings of Epicurus were
        to an equal degree attractive. Epicurus, for instance, in the very same
        paragraph in which he denominates pleasure as &quot;the beginning and
        the end of the happy life,&quot; lays down the principle that sometimes
        we deliberately choose to endure pain for the sake of a subsequent
        pleasure that outweighs the pain. Paul, in his turn, in the very same
        sentence of Hebrews 12:2, where he tacitly scorns pleasure as &quot;the
        beginning and the end of the happy life&quot; and hails Jesus instead as
        &quot;the beginner and the finisher of our faith,&quot; makes this
        momentous addition: &quot;who for the joy that was set before him
        endured the cross.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">This plainly exemplifies the sober formula of
        Epicurus, that the pain is deliberately chosen for the sake of the
        pleasure that outweighs it, but with what a difference! A studied
        formula of everyday morality, activated by expediency, has been lifted
        out of the earthly code of conduct in which it was conceived, raised to
        the spiritual level of experience, and endowed with a meaningfulness of
        which it had seemed incapable.

        <p align="justify"><font size="4">T</font><font size="2">HE</font> teachings of Epicurus were
        well known to Paul and to multitudes of people in his day. A few of the
        more outstanding examples are here appended.</p>
        <p align="justify">The first of these deals with the divine nature and
        was long vexatious to Christians on account of its tacit criticism of
        &quot;the wrath of God.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Authorized Doctrine 1: &quot;The blessed and
        incorruptible being neither knows tribulation itself nor occasions it to
        another; it is consequently immune to feelings of either anger or
        gratitude, for all such emotion signifies a weak creature.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">The second example deals with the topic of death and
        by the force of repulsion furnished much of the inspiration for Paul's
        eloquent exposition of the new immortality in First Corinthians 15.</p>

        Peace and Safety</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">In Second Thessalonians 5:3 Paul identifies the
        Epicureans by the words &quot;Peace and Safety.&quot; The extent to
        which the mind of Epicurus was preoccupied by this topic is made clear
        by the following extracts.</p>
        <p align="justify">Quoted by Plutarch: &quot;Live and die unknown.&quot;
        Epicurus means that the obscure life is the safest.</p>
        <p align="justify">Authorized Doctrine 6: &quot;Political rule and
        kingly power being what they are, it is a good thing to feel secure in
        human relations no matter through whose agency one is able to attain
        this.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Authorized Doctrine 7: &quot;Some men wish to gain
        reputation and to be in the public eye, thinking by this means to win
        security from the attacks of men. Consequently, if the lives of these
        men are safe they have achieved the end ordained by Nature; if, on the
        contrary, their lives are not safe they lack that for which at the
        outset they reached out in obedience to an instinct of Nature.&quot;</p>
        <p align="justify">Authorized Doctrine 13: &quot;It is of no avail to
        have established security in human relations if things above and in the
        earth beneath and those in the infinite universe in general are viewed
        with uncertainty.&quot;</p>

        from the injuries of men may have been established to a certain degree

        The Letter to Menoeceus</font></p>

        <p align="justify">Paul shows himself familiar with the letter to
        Menoeceus, which is the best specimen extant of the writings of
        Epicurus. It belongs in the class known as protreptic or hortatory,
        urging the study of philosophy as the guide of life. It was no more
        intended for the exclusive instruction of Menoeceus than the Epistles to
        Timothy were intended for his exclusive use.</p>

        Epicurus to Menoeceus: Greetings.</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="justify">&quot;Let no one delay to philosophize while he is
        young nor weary in philosophizing when he is old, for no one is either
        short of the age or past the age for enjoying health of the soul. And
        the man who says the time for philosophizing has not yet come or is
        already past may be compared to the man who says the time for happiness
        is not yet come or is already gone by. So both the young man and the old
        man should philosophize, the former that while growing old he may be
        young in blessings because of gratitude for what has been, the latter
        that he may be young and old at the same time because of the
        fearlessness with which he faces the future. Therefore the wise plan is
        to practice the things that make for happiness, since possessing
        happiness we have everything and not possessing it we do everything to
        have it.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b>&nbsp;<br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">THE GODS</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;Both practice and study the precepts which I
        continuously urged upon you, discerning these to be the A B C's of the
        good life. First of all, believing the divine being to be blessed and
        incorruptible, just as the universal idea of it is outlined in our
        minds, associate nothing with it that is incompatible with incorruption
        or alien to blessedness. And cultivate every thought concerning it that
        can preserve its blessedness along with incorruption. Because there are
        gods, for the knowledge of them is plain to see. They are not, however,
        such as many suppose them to be, for people do not keep their accounts
        of them consistent with their beliefs. And it is not the man who would
        abolish the gods of the multitude who is impious but the man who
        associates the beliefs of the multitude with the gods; for the
        pronouncements of the multitude concerning the gods are not innate ideas
        but false assumptions. According to their stories the greatest injuries
        and indignities are said to be inflicted upon evil men, and also
        benefits.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b>&nbsp;<br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">THE GODS INDIFFERENT TO WICKEDNESS</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;[These stories are false, because the gods],
        being exclusively devoted to virtues that become themselves, feel an
        affinity for those like themselves and regard all that is not of this
        kind as alien.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b><br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">DEATH</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;Habituate yourself to the belief that death is
        nothing to us, because all good and evil lies in consciousness and death
        is the loss of consciousness. Hence a right understanding of the fact
        that death is nothing to us renders enjoyable the mortality of life, not
        by adding infinite time but by taking away the yearning for immortality,
        for there is nothing to be feared while living by the man who has
        genuinely grasped the idea that there is nothing to be feared when not
        living.</p>
        <p align="justify">So the man is silly who says that he fears death, not
        because it will pain him when it comes, but because it pains him in
        prospect; for nothing that occasions no trouble when present has any
        right to pain us in anticipation. Therefore death, the most frightening
        of evils, is nothing to us, for the excellent reason that while we live
        it is not here and when it is here we are not living. So it is nothing
        either to the living or to the dead, because it is of no concern to the
        living and the dead are no longer.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b>&nbsp;<br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">THE INCONSISTENCY OF PEOPLE</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;But the multitude of men at one time shun death
        as the greatest of evils and at another choose death as an escape from
        the evils of life. The wise man, however, neither asks quarter of life
        nor has he any fear of not living, for he has no fault to find with life
        nor does he think it any evil to be out of it. Just as in the case of
        food, he does not always choose the largest portion but rather the most
        enjoyable; so with time, he does not pick the longest span of it but the
        most enjoyable.</p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;And the one who bids the young man 'Live well'
        and the old man 'Die well' is simple-minded, not only because of the
        pleasure of being alive, but also for the reason that the art of living
        well and dying well is one and the same. And far worse is he who says:
        'It were well never to have been born or having been born to have passed
        with all speed through the gates of Hades.' For if he is saying this out
        of conviction, why does he not take leave of life? Because this course
        is open to him if he has resolutely made up his mind to it. But if he is
        speaking in mockery, he is trifling in the case of things that do not
        countenance trifling.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b>&nbsp;<br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">THE FUTURE</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;As for the future, we must bear in mind that it
        is not quite beyond our control nor yet quite within our control, so
        that we must neither await it as going to be quite within our control
        nor despair of it as going to be quite beyond our control.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b>&nbsp;<br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">THE DESIRES</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;As for the desires, we should reflect that some
        are natural and some are imaginary; and of the natural desires some are
        necessary and some are natural only; and of the necessary desires some
        are necessary to happiness [he refers to friendship], and others to the
        comfort of the body [clothing and housing], and others to life itself
        [hunger and thirst].</p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;Because a correct appraisal of the desires
        enables us to refer every decision to choose or to avoid to the test of
        the health of the body and the tranquillity of the soul, for this is the
        objective of the happy life. For to this end we do everything, that we
        may feel neither pain nor fear. When once this boon is in our
        possession, every tumult of the soul is stilled, the creature having
        nothing to work forward to as something lacking or something additional
        to seek whereby the good of the soul and the body shall arrive at
        fullness. For only then have we need of pleasure when from the absence
        of pleasure we feel pain; and conversely, when we no longer feel pain we
        no longer feel need of pleasure.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b>&nbsp;<br>
        <font size="2" face="Arial">THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE HAPPY LIFE</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;And for the following reason we say that
        pleasure is the beginning and the end of the happy life: because we
        recognize pleasure as the first good and connate with us and to this we
        have recourse as to a canon, judging every good by the reaction. And for
        the reason that pleasure is the first good and of one nature with us we
        do not choose every pleasure but at one time or another forgo many
        pleasures when a distress that will outweigh them follows in consequence
        of these pleasures; and many pains we believe to be preferable to
        pleasures when a pleasure that will outweigh them ensues for us after
        enduring those pains for a long time. Therefore every pleasure is good
        because it is of one nature with us but every pleasure is not to be
        chosen; by the same reasoning every pain is an evil but every pain is
        not such as to be avoided at all times.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b>&nbsp;<br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">EXPEDIENCY: THE CALCULUS OF ADVANTAGE</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;The right procedure, however, is to weigh them
        against one another and to scrutinize the advantages and disadvantages;
        for we treat the good under certain circumstances as an evil and
        conversely the evil as a good.</p>
        <p align="justify"><b>&nbsp;<br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">SELF-SUFFICIENCY OR CONTENTMENT WITH LITTLE</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;And self-sufficiency we believe to be a great
        good, not that we may live on little under all circumstances but that we
        may be content with little when we do not have plenty, being genuinely
        convinced that they enjoy luxury most who feel the least need of it;
        that every natural appetite is easily gratified but the unnatural
        appetite difficult to gratify; and that plain foods bring a pleasure
        equal to that of a luxurious diet when all the pain originating in need
        has been removed; and that bread and water bring the most utter pleasure
        when one in need of them brings them to his lips.</p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;Thus habituation to simple and inexpensive
        diets not only contributes to perfect health but also renders a man
        unshrinking in face of the inevitable emergencies of life; and it
        disposes us better toward the times of abundance that ensue after
        intervals of scarcity and renders us fearless in the face of Fortune.
        When therefore we say that pleasure is the end we do not mean the
        pleasures of profligates and those that consist in high living, as
        certain people think, either not understanding us and holding to
        different views or willfully misrepresenting us; but we mean freedom
        from pain in the body and turmoil in the soul. For it is not protracted
        drinking bouts and revels nor yet sexual pleasures with boys and women
        nor rare dishes of fish and the rest <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

        pleasurably without living according to reason, honor, and justice, and
        conversely, of living according to reason, honor, and justice without
        living pleasurably; for the virtues are of one nature with the
        pleasurable life and conversely, the pleasurable life is inseparable

        <font face="Arial" size="2">DESCRIPTION OF THE HAPPY MAN</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;Because who do you think is in better case than
        the man who holds pious beliefs concerning the gods and is invariably
        fearless of death; and has included in his reckoning the end of life as
        ordained by Nature; and concerning the utmost of things good discerns
        this to be easy to enjoy to the full and easy of procurement, while the
        utmost of things evil is either brief in duration or brief in suffering.</p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;He has abolished the Necessity that is
        introduced by some thinkers as the mistress of all things, for it were
        better to subscribe to the myths concerning the gods than to be a slave
        to the Destiny of the physicists, because the former presumes a hope of
        mercy through worship but the latter assumes Necessity to be inexorable.</p>
        <p align="justify">&quot;As for Fortune, he does not assume that she is
        a goddess, as the multitude believes, for nothing is done at random by a
        god; neither does he think her a fickle cause, for he does not suppose
        that either good or evil is dealt out to men by her to affect life's
        happiness; yet he does believe the starting points for great good or
        evil to originate with her, thinking it better to plan well and fail
        than to plan badly and succeed, for in the conduct of life it profits
        more for good judgment to miscarry than for misjudgment to prosper by
        chance.</p>
